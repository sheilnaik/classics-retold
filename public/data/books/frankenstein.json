I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking. </p>\n<p> I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this feeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes. Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour. There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his native river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine. </p>\n<p> These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as a steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye. This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean through the seas which surround the pole. You may remember that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good Uncle Thomas’ library. My education was neglected, yet I was passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt, as a child, on learning that my father’s dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life. </p>\n<p> These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. I also became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation; I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated. You are well acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment. But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent. </p>\n<p> Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I can, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great enterprise. I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea; I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as an under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services. </p>\n<p> And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose? My life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing. </p>\n<p> This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in my opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach. The cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs—a dress which I have already adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins. I have no ambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel. </p>\n<p> I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to sail until the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how can I answer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years, will pass before you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon, or never. </p>\n<p> Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on you, and save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your love and kindness. </p> <p class=\"right\"> Your affectionate brother,<br> R. Walton </p> </a></div>",
      "modern": "<p>Letter 1</p>\n<p>To Mrs. Saville, England.</p>\n<p>St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17—.</p>\n<p>You will be glad to hear that nothing disastrous has happened at the start of an adventure that you have viewed with such apprehension. I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my well-being and growing confidence in the success of my mission. I am already far north of London, and as I walk through the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze brushing against my cheeks, invigorating my nerves and filling me with joy. Do you understand this feeling? This breeze, which has traveled from the regions I’m heading towards, gives me a taste of those icy lands. Encouraged by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more passionate and vivid. I try in vain to convince myself that the pole is a place of frost and desolation; it always appears in my imagination as a realm of beauty and joy.</p>\n<p>There, Margaret, the sun is always visible, its broad disk just touching the horizon and spreading a constant brilliance. There—if you’ll allow me, my sister, to trust the accounts of earlier explorers—there snow and ice are absent; and, sailing over a calm sea, we might be carried to a land that surpasses in wonders and beauty every region discovered so far on this planet. Its features and wonders may be unparalleled, just as the phenomena of the stars undoubtedly are in those uncharted solitudes. What might we not discover in a land of eternal light? I might find the extraordinary force that attracts the compass, and I could clarify a thousand celestial observations that only this journey could make consistent forever. I will satisfy my intense curiosity by seeing parts of the world never before visited, and I may walk on land that has never felt the imprint of a human foot. These are the attractions that conquer all fear of danger or death and inspire me to begin this challenging voyage with the joy a child feels when he sets off in a small boat, with his friends, on an adventure of discovery up his local river.</p>\n<p>But even if all these hopes turn out to be false, you cannot dispute the invaluable benefit I will bring to humanity, for generations to come, by finding a route near the pole to those countries, which currently take months to reach; or by uncovering the secret of the magnet, which, if possible at all, can only be achieved through a mission like mine. These reflections have eased the anxiety with which I began my letter, and I feel my heart swell with an enthusiasm that lifts me to the heavens, for nothing calms the mind like a strong purpose—a goal for the soul to focus its intellectual gaze upon. This expedition has been the cherished dream of my youth. I have eagerly read accounts of various voyages made in the hope of reaching the North Pacific Ocean through the seas that surround the pole. You may remember that our dear Uncle Thomas’ library was filled with histories of all the voyages undertaken for discovery. My education was lacking, yet I was passionately in love with reading. Those volumes were my studies day and night, and my familiarity with them deepened the regret I felt as a child upon learning that my father’s last wish had forbidden my uncle from allowing me to pursue a seafaring life.</p>\n<p>Those dreams faded when I first read the poets whose words enchanted my soul and lifted it to the heavens. I too became a poet and for a year lived in a paradise of my own making; I imagined that I might also earn a place in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakespeare are honored. You know well my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment. But just then, I inherited my cousin’s fortune, and my thoughts turned back to their original course. Six years have passed since I committed myself to this grand endeavor. I can still remember the moment I dedicated myself to this great task. I began by toughening my body for hardship. I joined the whale fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea; I willingly endured cold, hunger, thirst, and lack of sleep; I often worked harder than the regular sailors during the day and devoted my nights to studying mathematics, medicine, and those areas of physical science that would offer the greatest practical advantage to a naval adventurer. Twice, I even hired myself as a second mate on a Greenland whaler and performed admirably. I must admit I felt a bit proud when my captain offered me the second highest rank on the ship and earnestly urged me to stay, for he considered my services so valuable.</p>\n<p>And now, dear Margaret, don’t I deserve to achieve something great? My life could have been spent in comfort and luxury, but I chose glory over every temptation that wealth offered me. Oh, that some encouraging voice would affirm my choices! My courage and resolve are strong, but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits often waver. I am about to embark on a long and difficult journey, the challenges of which will require all my strength: I must not only lift the spirits of others, but sometimes bolster my own when theirs are faltering. This is the best time for traveling in Russia. They glide swiftly over the snow in their sleds; the motion is enjoyable and, in my opinion, far more pleasant than riding in an English stagecoach. The cold is not unbearable if you’re bundled in furs—a clothing choice I have already made, for there’s a vast difference between walking the deck and sitting still for hours, where no movement prevents the blood from freezing in your veins. I have no desire to lose my life on the road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel. I plan to leave for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; my intention is to hire a ship there, which can be easily arranged by covering the owner’s insurance, and to recruit as many sailors as I think necessary from those experienced in whale fishing. I do not plan to set sail until June; and when will I return? Ah, dear sister, how can I answer that? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years, will pass before we meet again. If I fail, you will see me soon, or perhaps never.</p>\n<p>Farewell, my dear, wonderful Margaret. May heaven shower you with blessings, and may it save me, so I can repeatedly express my gratitude for all your love and kindness.</p>\n<p>Your affectionate brother,  \nR. Walton</p>",

Yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have already engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage. </p>\n<p> But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling. I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose eyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I bitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution and too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me that I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas’ books of voyages. At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native country. Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more and that my daydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters call it) <i>keeping;</i> and I greatly need a friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind. </p>\n<p> Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these rugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase more characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an Englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices, unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity. I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel; finding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise. </p>\n<p> The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This circumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made me very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be necessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the happiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved a young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father would never consent to the union. My generous friend reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover, instantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young woman’s father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who, when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her inclinations. “What a noble fellow!” you will exclaim. He is so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command. </p>\n<p> Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can conceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am wavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. The winter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it is considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail sooner than I expected. I shall do nothing rashly: you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the safety of others is committed to my care. </p>\n<p> I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking. It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which I am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to “the land of mist and snow,” but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not be alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and woeful as the “Ancient Mariner.” You will smile at my allusion, but I will disclose a secret. I have often attributed my attachment to, my passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that production of the most imaginative of modern poets. There is something at work in my soul which I do not understand. I am practically industrious—painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and labour—but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited regions I am about to explore. </p>\n<p> But to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, after having traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of Africa or America? I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to look on the reverse of the picture. Continue for the present to write to me by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when I need them most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly. Remember me with affection, should you never hear from me again. </p> <p class=\"right\"> Your affectionate brother,<br> Robert Walton </p> </a></div>",
      "modern": "<p>Letter 2</p>\n<p>To Mrs. Saville, England.  \nArchangel, 28th March, 17—.</p>\n<p>Time moves so slowly for me here, surrounded by frost and snow! Yet I have taken another step toward my goal. I’ve hired a ship and am busy gathering my crew; those I’ve hired so far seem reliable and certainly brave. However, there’s one thing I deeply miss, and its absence feels like a major loss—I have no friend, Margaret. When I’m filled with the excitement of success, there will be no one to share my joy; and if I face disappointment, no one to help lift my spirits. I will write down my thoughts, it’s true, but that’s a poor substitute for genuine connection. I long for the company of someone who can understand me, someone whose eyes reflect my own feelings. You might think I’m being overly sentimental, my dear sister, but I profoundly feel the lack of a friend.</p>\n<p>I have no one near me who is both gentle and brave, someone with a refined and broad mind, whose tastes align with mine, to approve or critique my plans. How much a friend like that could improve your poor brother! I tend to be too passionate in my pursuits and too impatient when faced with challenges. But an even greater issue for me is that I’m self-taught; for the first fourteen years of my life, I roamed freely and only read our Uncle Thomas’s books on voyages. It wasn’t until I was older that I discovered the great poets of our country, and only when I realized I was no longer in a position to fully appreciate their wisdom did I understand the need to learn more languages than my own. Now, at twenty-eight, I find myself even less educated than many fifteen-year-olds.</p>\n<p>It’s true that I think more deeply and my daydreams are grander, but they lack, as painters say, refinement; and I desperately need a friend who is wise enough not to dismiss me as a dreamer, and caring enough to help me focus my thoughts. Well, these are useless complaints; I won’t find a friend on the vast ocean, or even here in Archangel, among merchants and sailors. Yet, some feelings, untouched by the coarseness of humanity, do exist even in these rugged hearts.</p>\n<p>My lieutenant, for example, is a man of remarkable courage and ambition; he is fervently eager for glory, or more accurately, to use a better term, advancement in his career. He is English, and despite the national and professional biases that come from a lack of education, he still possesses some of the finest qualities of humanity. I first met him on a whaling ship; finding him unemployed in this city, I easily convinced him to join my mission. The captain is a man of excellent character, known for his gentleness and fair discipline. This, along with his well-known integrity and bravery, made me eager to have him on board.</p>\n<p>Having spent my youth in solitude, with my best years nurtured under your gentle care, I find I cannot tolerate the usual brutality often seen on ships. I’ve never believed it to be necessary, and when I heard of a sailor distinguished for his kindness and the respect his crew shows him, I felt incredibly fortunate to secure his services. I first heard about him in a rather romantic way, from a lady who credits him with her happiness. Here’s a brief overview of his story.</p>\n<p>A few years ago, he fell in love with a young Russian woman of modest means. After earning a significant amount in prize money, her father agreed to the match. He saw his beloved once before the wedding, but she was in tears, pleading at his feet, confessing that she loved another man who was poor and that her father would never allow their union. My noble friend comforted her and, upon learning the name of her true love, immediately abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his savings, intending to live there for the rest of his days, but he gave it all to his rival, along with the remainder of his prize money to help him get started, and then he sought the young woman’s father to allow her to marry her true love. Yet the old man flatly refused, feeling honor-bound to my friend. When he realized the father would not budge, he left his country and did not return until he heard that his former love had married according to her wishes.</p>\n<p>“What a noble fellow!” you might exclaim. He truly is, but he is entirely uneducated; he is as quiet as a Turk, and a sort of ignorant carelessness surrounds him, which, while making his actions even more remarkable, detracts from the interest and sympathy he could otherwise inspire. But please don’t assume that just because I express some frustration or because I can envision a consolation for my struggles that I am wavering in my determination. My resolve is as firm as fate, and my voyage is only delayed until the weather allows me to set sail. This winter has been brutally harsh, but spring is looking promising, and it’s considered an unusually early season, so I may be able to depart sooner than I expected.</p>\n<p>I won’t act impulsively; you know me well enough to trust in my caution and thoughtfulness whenever the safety of others is in my hands. I can’t describe to you the feelings I have as I prepare for my journey. It’s impossible to convey the mixture of excitement and fear I feel at the thought of leaving. I’m heading into uncharted territories, to “the land of mist and snow,” but I won’t harm any albatrosses; so please don’t worry about my safety, or if I return to you as weary and sorrowful as the “Ancient Mariner.”</p>\n<p>You might smile at my reference, but I’ll let you in on a secret. I often trace my fascination and fervent enthusiasm for the perilous mysteries of the ocean back to that work by the most imaginative of modern poets. There’s something stirring within my soul that I can’t quite understand. I am industrious and hardworking, committed to executing my plans with perseverance, but alongside that, there’s a love for the extraordinary, a belief in the miraculous, woven into all my endeavors, driving me away from the ordinary paths of life and toward the wild sea and uncharted regions I am about to explore.</p>\n<p>But let’s return to more personal matters. Will I see you again after crossing vast oceans and returning by the southern tip of Africa or America? I dare not hope for such success, yet I can’t bear to envision the alternative. Please continue to write to me whenever you can; I may receive your letters at times when I need them most to lift my spirits. I love you dearly. Remember me fondly, even if you never hear from me again.</p>\n<p>Your loving brother,  \nRobert Walton</p>",

      "original": "<div class=\"chapter\" id=\"pgepubid00006\"> <h2><a id=\"letter4\">Letter 4</a></h2><a id=\"letter4\"> <p class=\"letter2\"> <i>To Mrs. Saville, England.</i> </p> <p class=\"right\"> August 5th, 17—. </p>\n<p> So strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear recording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your possession. </p>\n<p> Last Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which she floated. Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog. We accordingly lay to, hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather. </p>\n<p> About two o’clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to have no end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own situation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature, sat in the sledge and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the ice. </p>\n<p> This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed, many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the greatest attention. </p>\n<p> About two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before night the ice broke and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the morning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this time to rest for a few hours. </p>\n<p> In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently talking to someone in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large fragment of ice. Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel. He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island, but a European. When I appeared on deck the master said, “Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea.” </p>\n<p> On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a foreign accent. “Before I come on board your vessel,” said he, “will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?” </p>\n<p> You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. I replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole. </p>\n<p> Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board. Good God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety, your surprise would have been boundless. His limbs were nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering. I never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air he fainted. We accordingly brought him back to the deck and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to swallow a small quantity. As soon as he showed signs of life we wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen stove. By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup, which restored him wonderfully. </p>\n<p> Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When he had in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and attended on him as much as my duty would permit. I never saw a more interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of wildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he is generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him. </p>\n<p> When my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose. Once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle. </p>\n<p> His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and he replied, “To seek one who fled from me.” </p>\n<p> “And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?” </p>\n<p> “Yes.” </p>\n<p> “Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.” </p>\n<p> This aroused the stranger’s attention, and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had pursued. Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, “I have, doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.” </p>\n<p> “Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.” </p>\n<p> “And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have benevolently restored me to life.” </p>\n<p> Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge. I replied that I could not answer with any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time; but of this I could not judge. </p>\n<p> From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger. He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere. I have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight. </p>\n<p> Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present day. The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin. Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all interested in him, although they have had very little communication with him. For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion. He must have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable. </p>\n<p> I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend on the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been broken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart. </p>\n<p> I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, should I have any fresh incidents to record. </p> <p class=\"right\"> August 13th, 17—. </p>\n<p> My affection for my guest increases every day. He excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief? He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art, yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence. </p>\n<p> He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck, apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests himself deeply in the projects of others. He has frequently conversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without disguise. He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken to secure it. I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my enterprise. One man’s life or death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race. As I spoke, a dark gloom spread over my listener’s countenance. At first I perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before his eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast. I paused; at length he spoke, in broken accents: “Unhappy man! Do you share my madness? Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me; let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!” </p>\n<p> Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure. </p>\n<p> Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of despair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally. He asked me the history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told, but it awakened various trains of reflection. I spoke of my desire of finding a friend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing. </p>\n<p> “I agree with you,” replied the stranger; “we are unfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves—such a friend ought to be—do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I once had a friend, the most noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting friendship. You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for despair. But I—I have lost everything and cannot begin life anew.” </p>\n<p> As he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled grief that touched me to the heart. But he was silent and presently retired to his cabin. </p>\n<p> Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a double existence: he may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures. </p>\n<p> Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine wanderer? You would not if you saw him. You have been tutored and refined by books and retirement from the world, and you are therefore somewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man. Sometimes I have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that elevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew. I believe it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but never-failing power of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled for clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression and a voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music. </p> <p class=\"right\"> August 19th, 17—. </p>\n<p> Yesterday the stranger said to me, “You may easily perceive, Captain Walton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with me, but you have won me to alter my determination. You seek for knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been. I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same course, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you in case of failure. Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous. Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might fear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers of nature; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.” </p>\n<p> You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered communication, yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes. I felt the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power. I expressed these feelings in my answer. </p>\n<p> “I thank you,” he replied, “for your sympathy, but it is useless; my fate is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then I shall repose in peace. I understand your feeling,” continued he, perceiving that I wished to interrupt him; “but you are mistaken, my friend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my destiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is determined.” </p>\n<p> He then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when I should be at leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I have resolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during the day. If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes. This manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure; but to me, who know him, and who hear it from his own lips—with what interest and sympathy shall I read it in some future day! Even now, as I commence my task, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in animation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul within. Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it—thus! </p> </a></div>",
      "modern": "<p>Letter 4</p>\n<p>To Mrs. Saville, England.</p>\n<p>August 5th, 17—.</p>\n<p>Something so strange has happened to us that I feel compelled to write it down, even though it's likely you will see me before you receive this letter. Last Monday (July 31st), we found ourselves almost completely surrounded by ice, which closed in around the ship, leaving barely enough space for her to float. Our situation was quite dangerous, especially since we were surrounded by a thick fog. We decided to stay put, hoping for a change in the weather.</p>\n<p>Around two o'clock, the mist began to clear, revealing vast, irregular plains of ice stretching endlessly in every direction. Some of my crewmates groaned, and I felt a growing anxiety when something strange caught our attention and distracted us from our predicament. We saw a low carriage on a sled, pulled by dogs, moving northward about half a mile away. In the sled sat a figure that looked like a man but appeared to be of gigantic size, guiding the dogs. We watched the traveler’s rapid progress through our telescopes until he disappeared among the distant ice formations. This sight filled us with wonder. We believed we were hundreds of miles from any land, yet this figure suggested that we weren't as isolated as we thought. However, trapped in the ice, we couldn't follow his path, which we had been observing closely.</p>\n<p>About two hours later, we heard the sound of the sea, and by nightfall, the ice broke apart, freeing our ship. We decided to remain still until morning, fearing the large, loose chunks that float after the ice breaks. I took this time to rest for a few hours.</p>\n<p>In the morning, as soon as it was light, I went on deck and found all the sailors gathered on one side of the ship, seemingly speaking to someone in the water. It was indeed another sled, like the one we had seen earlier, that had drifted toward us on a large piece of ice. Only one dog was still alive, but there was a human being inside whom the sailors were trying to persuade to come aboard. He was not, like the earlier traveler, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island, but a European. When I appeared on deck, the captain said, “Here’s our captain, and he won’t let you perish out here in the open sea.”</p>\n<p>Upon seeing me, the stranger spoke in English, albeit with a foreign accent. “Before I come on board your vessel,” he said, “would you kindly tell me where you are headed?” You can imagine my astonishment at hearing such a question from a man on the brink of death, who I would have thought would consider my ship a lifeline worth more than any treasure on earth. I replied that we were on a voyage of discovery toward the North Pole. Upon hearing this, he seemed satisfied and agreed to come aboard.</p>\n<p>Good God, Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus negotiated for his safety, your surprise would have been boundless. His limbs were nearly frozen, and his body was dreadfully emaciated from fatigue and suffering. I had never seen anyone in such a wretched state. We tried to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he left the fresh air, he fainted. We brought him back to the deck and revived him by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to swallow a small amount. Once he showed signs of life, we wrapped him in blankets and placed him near the kitchen stove. Gradually, he recovered and ate a bit of soup, which seemed to restore him significantly.</p>\n<p>Two days passed before he was able to speak, and I often feared that his sufferings had taken away his sanity. When he had somewhat recovered, I moved him to my own cabin and took care of him as much as my duties allowed. I had never seen a more fascinating person: his eyes often had an expression of wildness, and even madness, but there were moments when, if someone showed him an act of kindness or offered him the slightest help, his entire face would light up with a warmth and sweetness I had never seen before. Yet, he was generally melancholy and despairing, sometimes gnashing his teeth as if he was overwhelmed by the weight of his troubles.</p>\n<p>When my guest began to recover, I had a hard time keeping the men away, as they were eager to ask him a thousand questions. I wouldn’t allow them to torment him with their idle curiosity while he was in such a fragile state of body and mind, one that depended on his complete rest. However, once the lieutenant asked why he had come so far onto the ice in such an unusual vehicle. His face instantly clouded with deep sorrow, and he replied, “To seek one who fled from me.”</p>\n<p>“And did the man you were chasing travel in the same way?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>“Then I believe we’ve seen him, for the day before we picked you up, we saw some dogs pulling a sled with a man in it across the ice.” This piqued the stranger’s interest, and he began asking numerous questions about the route that the “demon,” as he called him, had taken.</p>\n<p>Soon after, when we were alone, he said, “I have, no doubt, piqued your curiosity, as well as that of these good people; but you are too kind to pry.”</p>\n<p>“Of course; it would be quite rude and inhumane for me to disturb you with my questions.”</p>\n<p>“And yet you rescued me from a strange and dangerous situation; you have benevolently brought me back to life.”</p>\n<p>Not long after this, he asked if I thought the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sled. I replied that I couldn’t say for certain, as the ice hadn’t broken until near midnight, and the traveler might have reached safety before that. But I couldn’t judge. From that moment, a new spirit of life seemed to animate the stranger's fading frame. He was eager to be on deck to watch for the sled that had appeared earlier, but I persuaded him to stay in the cabin, as he was far too weak to endure the harsh atmosphere. I promised him that someone would keep watch for him and notify him immediately if anything new came into sight.</p>\n<p>This is my account of this strange occurrence up to this point. The stranger has gradually improved in health, but he remains very quiet and seems uneasy when anyone but me enters his cabin. Yet his demeanor is so gentle and kind that the sailors are all drawn to him, even though they have had very little interaction with him. For my part, I find myself growing fond of him like a brother, and his constant, deep sorrow fills me with sympathy and compassion. He must have been a noble man in better days, as even now, in his broken state, he is still so attractive and amiable.</p>\n<p>I mentioned in one of my letters, dear Margaret, that I would find no friend on this vast ocean; yet I have found a man whom, before his spirit was crushed by suffering, I would have been happy to have as the brother of my heart. I will continue my journal about the stranger from time to time, should I have any new incidents to record.</p>\n<p>August 13th, 17—.</p>\n<p>My affection for my guest grows every day. He inspires both my admiration and pity to an astonishing degree. How can I witness such a noble creature destroyed by misery without feeling profound grief? He is gentle yet wise; his mind is so cultivated, and when he speaks, even though his words are carefully chosen, they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence. He has much recovered from his illness and spends his time on deck, seemingly watching for the sled that came before him. Yet, although he is unhappy, he is not so consumed by his own misery that he does not take a deep interest in the plans of others. He has frequently discussed my endeavors with me, which I have shared with him openly.</p>\n<p>I was easily led by the sympathy he showed to express the language of my heart, passionately declaring how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, for the success of my enterprise. One man’s life or death is a small price to pay for the knowledge I seek, for the mastery I aim to achieve over the elemental forces that challenge our species. As I spoke, a dark gloom spread across his face. At first, I noticed he tried to suppress his emotion; he covered his eyes with his hands, and my voice faltered as I saw tears streaming through his fingers; a groan escaped from his heaving chest. I paused, and eventually, he spoke in broken tones: “Unhappy man! Do you share my madness? Have you also drunk from the intoxicating cup? Hear me; let me tell you my story, and you will throw the cup from your lips!”</p>\n<p>You can imagine how much these words stirred my curiosity, but the wave of grief that had seized the stranger overwhelmed his frail state, and he needed many hours of rest and calm conversation to regain his composure. Once he managed to control his emotions, he seemed to disdain himself for being a slave to passion, and pushing aside the dark despair, he once again turned the conversation to me. He asked about my early years.</p>\n<p>The story was quickly told, but it sparked various reflections. I spoke of my desire to find a friend, of my longing for a deeper connection with another mind than I had ever experienced, and I expressed my belief that a person could claim little happiness if they did not enjoy this blessing.</p>\n<p>“I agree with you,” replied the stranger; “we are unfinished beings, half-formed, if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves—such a friend should be—does not help to perfect our weak and flawed natures. I once had a friend, the noblest of human beings, and I am therefore qualified to judge the value of friendship. You have hope, and the world is before you; you have no cause for despair. But I—I have lost everything and cannot start anew.”</p>\n<p>As he spoke, his expression revealed a calm, settled grief that touched my heart. But he fell silent and soon returned to his cabin. Even in his broken spirit, no one feels more deeply than he does the beauty of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and all that these wondrous regions offer still seem to have the power to lift his soul above earthly concerns. Such a man has a double existence: he may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointment, yet when he retreats into himself, he resembles a celestial being, surrounded by a halo, within whose circle no grief or foolishness dares to intrude.</p>\n<p>Will you smile at my enthusiasm for this divine wanderer? You wouldn't if you saw him. You have been refined through books and solitude from the world, and so you may be somewhat critical; but this only makes you more capable of appreciating the extraordinary qualities of this remarkable man. Sometimes I have tried to discern what it is about him that elevates him so far above anyone else I’ve ever known. I believe it is an intuitive insight, a sharp yet unfailing judgment, a deep penetration into the causes of things, unmatched in clarity and precision; combined with this is an ease of expression and a voice whose varied tones are soul-stirring music.</p>\n<p>August 19th, 17—.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, the stranger said to me, “You can easily tell, Captain Walton, that I have endured great and unparalleled misfortunes. I once resolved that the memory of these evils should die with me, but you have persuaded me to change my mind. You seek knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I fervently hope that the fulfillment of your wishes does not become a serpent to sting you, as mine has been. I cannot say whether recounting my disasters will be beneficial to you; yet, when I think that you are pursuing the same path, exposing yourself to the same dangers that have turned me into what I am, I believe you may draw a valuable lesson from my story, one that may guide you if you succeed in your mission and console you if you fail. Prepare to hear of events that are usually considered miraculous. Had we been in more peaceful surroundings, I might fear your disbelief, perhaps even your ridicule; but many things will seem possible in these wild and mysterious regions that would provoke laughter from those unfamiliar with the ever-changing powers of nature; nor can I doubt that my tale carries undeniable evidence of the truth of the events I will recount.”</p>\n<p>You can easily imagine that I was very pleased by his willingness to share his story, yet I couldn't bear the thought of him renewing his sorrow by relaying his misfortunes. I was filled with a strong eagerness to hear the promised narrative, partly out of curiosity and partly from a deep desire to improve his fate if it were within my power. I expressed these feelings in my response.</p>\n<p>“Thank you,” he replied, “for your sympathy, but it is useless; my fate is nearly fulfilled. I await just one event, and then I will find peace. I understand your feelings,” he continued, sensing that I wished to interrupt him; “but you are mistaken, my friend, if you allow me to call you that; nothing can change my destiny. Listen to my story, and you will see how irrevocably it is determined.” He then informed me that he would begin his narrative the following day when I would be free. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I have resolved that every night, when I am not urgently occupied with my duties, I will write down, as closely as possible in his own words, what he has shared during the day. If I am busy, I will at least take notes. This manuscript will surely bring you great joy; but for me, who knows him and hears it from his own lips—how I will read it with interest and sympathy one day in the future! Even now, as I begin my task, his rich voice resonates in my ears; his bright eyes rest on me with their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand gesturing animatedly, while the features of his face are lit up by the spirit within. Strange and harrowing must be his story, terrifying the storm that engulfed the brave vessel on its journey and wrecked it—thus!</p>",

      "original": "<div class=\"chapter\" id=\"pgepubid00007\"> <h2><a id=\"chap01\">Chapter 1</a></h2><a id=\"chap01\"> <p> I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family. </p>\n<p> As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts, therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in wretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances. He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them. He lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance. </p>\n<p> Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten months before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery, he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the Reuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchant’s house. The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion. </p>\n<p> His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that there was no other prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support her in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw and by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life. </p>\n<p> Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her, and she knelt by Beaufort’s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the chamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who committed herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he conducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a relation. Two years after this event Caroline became his wife. </p>\n<p> There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection. There was a sense of justice in my father’s upright mind which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love strongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her. Everything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. During the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders, as a restorative for her weakened frame. </p>\n<p> From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born at Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained for several years their only child. Much as they were attached to each other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother’s tender caresses and my father’s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something better—their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled their duties towards me. With this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity, and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but one train of enjoyment to me. </p>\n<p> For a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desired to have a daughter, but I continued their single offspring. When I was about five years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they passed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como. Their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor. This, to my mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a passion—remembering what she had suffered, and how she had been relieved—for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the afflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst shape. One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother, accompanied by me, visited this abode. She found a peasant and his wife, hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes. Among these there was one which attracted my mother far above all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The four others were dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair. Her hair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her clothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow was clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent, and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features. </p>\n<p> The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She was not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a German and had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with these good people to nurse: they were better off then. They had not been long married, and their eldest child was but just born. The father of their charge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory of Italy—one among the <i>schiavi ognor frementi,</i> who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the victim of its weakness. Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria was not known. His property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and a beggar. She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude abode, fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles. </p>\n<p> When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of our villa a child fairer than pictured cherub—a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence had seemed a blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and want when Providence afforded her such powerful protection. They consulted their village priest, and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenza became the inmate of my parents’ house—my more than sister—the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and my pleasures. </p>\n<p> Everyone loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential attachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my pride and my delight. On the evening previous to her being brought to my home, my mother had said playfully, “I have a pretty present for my Victor—tomorrow he shall have it.” And when, on the morrow, she presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish seriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabeth as mine—mine to protect, love, and cherish. All praises bestowed on her I received as made to a possession of my own. We called each other familiarly by the name of cousin. No word, no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me—my more than sister, since till death she was to be mine only. </p> </a></div>",
      "modern": "<p>Chapter 1</p>\n<p>I was born in Geneva, and my family is one of the most respected in that city. My ancestors had served as counselors and syndics for many years, and my father held several public positions with honor and respect. Everyone who knew him regarded him for his integrity and tireless dedication to public service. He spent his younger years deeply involved in the affairs of his country; various circumstances had delayed his marriage, and it wasn't until later in life that he became a husband and father.</p>\n<p>The circumstances surrounding his marriage reveal much about his character, so I feel compelled to share them. One of his closest friends was a merchant named Beaufort, who, after experiencing a series of unfortunate events, fell into poverty. Beaufort was proud and unyielding, unable to endure living in obscurity in the same place where he had once been known for his status and wealth. After settling his debts honorably, he retreated with his daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived in misery and anonymity. My father cherished his friendship with Beaufort and was deeply saddened by his friend's unfortunate situation. He lamented the pride that had driven Beaufort to such a desolate state, unworthy of their bond.</p>\n<p>Determined to help, my father quickly set out to find Beaufort, hoping to persuade him to rebuild his life with his support. It took ten months for my father to discover Beaufort's whereabouts, and upon finding him, he rushed to his home, which was located on a shabby street near the Reuss River. But when he arrived, he was met only with despair. Beaufort had saved a small sum of money from his misfortunes, just enough to sustain him for a few months while he sought respectable work in a merchant's house. During that time, he fell into a deeper state of inactivity and grief, ultimately leading to a sickness that left him bedridden after three months.</p>\n<p>His daughter, Caroline Beaufort, cared for him with unwavering tenderness, but she soon realized their meager resources were dwindling, and there seemed to be no hope for support. Nonetheless, Caroline was exceptionally strong-willed. She found ways to earn a little money by doing simple work like weaving straw, just barely enough to survive. Months passed, and her father's condition worsened. As she dedicated more time to caring for him, their means of survival diminished, and after ten months, her father died in her arms, leaving her an orphan and a beggar.</p>\n<p>This final blow overwhelmed her, and she knelt by Beaufort's coffin, weeping bitterly, when my father entered the room. He came like a guardian angel to the grieving girl, who entrusted herself to his care. After Beaufort's burial, my father brought her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a relative. Two years later, Caroline became his wife. Although there was a significant age difference between them, this only seemed to strengthen their bond of love and devotion.</p>\n<p>My father's sense of justice made him value love and affection deeply. Perhaps his past experiences had taught him to appreciate true worth even more. His feelings for my mother were marked by gratitude and admiration, quite different from the indulgent affection of old age. He revered her virtues and sought to repay her for the hardships she had endured, which added a remarkable grace to his treatment of her. He devoted himself to her wishes and comfort, shielding her like a delicate plant from harsh winds and surrounding her with everything that might bring her joy.</p>\n<p>My mother’s health and constant spirit had been shaken by her past experiences. In the two years leading up to their marriage, my father gradually stepped away from public life. Soon after their wedding, they traveled to the pleasant climate of Italy, hoping that the change of scenery and the wonders of the land would restore her health. From Italy, they journeyed to Germany and France. I, their first child, was born in Naples and traveled with them during their adventures. For several years, I was their only child.</p>\n<p>Despite their strong attachment to one another, they seemed to draw endless love from a deep well to share with me. My mother's gentle affection and my father's warm smile as he looked at me are some of my earliest memories. I was their cherished darling, their child, the innocent and helpless being entrusted to them by fate, whose upbringing and future happiness were their responsibility. With this awareness of their obligations toward me, combined with their nurturing spirit, it can be imagined that every moment of my early life was filled with lessons of patience, kindness, and self-control, all woven together in a tapestry of joy.</p>\n<p>For a long time, I was their sole focus. My mother had longed for a daughter, but I remained their only child. When I was about five years old, during a trip beyond the borders of Italy, they spent a week by the shores of Lake Como. Their generous nature often led them to visit the homes of the poor. For my mother, it was not merely an obligation but a passion born from her own suffering and the kindness she had received.</p>\n<p>One day, while my father was away in Milan, my mother took me to visit a humble home that caught their attention. It looked particularly forlorn, and the sight of several half-clothed children around it spoke of desperate poverty. Inside, we found a hardworking peasant couple, overwhelmed by their struggles, sharing a meager meal with five hungry little ones. Among them was one child who stood out to my mother. Unlike the other four, who were dark-eyed and sturdy, this girl was thin and very fair. Her hair shone like bright gold, and despite her ragged clothing, it seemed to crown her with a special grace.</p>\n<p>Her clear brow, cloudless blue eyes, and expressive lips gave her an air of sensitivity and sweetness that made her appear almost otherworldly—a being sent from heaven. The peasant woman, noticing my mother's captivated gaze, eagerly shared the child's story. She was not her daughter but the child of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was German and had died giving birth to her. The infant had been placed with this couple to nurse when they were better off. They had just married, and their first child was newly born. The girl's father was one of those Italians who cherished the ancient glories of Italy, striving for his country's freedom. Unfortunately, he fell victim to its weakness. His fate was unknown; whether he was dead or still imprisoned by the Austrians remained a mystery. His property was seized, and his daughter was left an orphan and a beggar. She thrived with her foster parents, blooming in their humble home like a rose among thorns.</p>\n<p>When my father returned from Milan, he found me playing with a child more beautiful than a painted angel—a creature who seemed to radiate light and whose movements were as graceful as the chamois on the hills. My mother, with my father's blessing, persuaded the girl's guardians to entrust her to us. They had grown fond of the sweet orphan, and while her presence was a blessing to them, it would be unfair to keep her in poverty when Providence offered her such protection. They consulted their village priest, and the outcome was that Elizabeth Lavenza became part of our family—my more-than-sister, the beautiful and beloved companion in all my activities and joys.</p>\n<p>Everyone adored Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential love everyone had for her was a source of pride and delight for me. The night before she was brought home, my mother playfully told me, \"I have a lovely surprise for Victor—he will receive it tomorrow.\" When the next day came and my mother introduced Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I took her words literally and saw Elizabeth as mine—mine to protect, love, and cherish. Every compliment given to her felt like it was directed at something I owned. We called each other \"cousin\" with familiarity. No words could truly express the relationship we shared—she was my more-than-sister, destined to be mine forever.</p>",

      "original": "<div class=\"chapter\" id=\"pgepubid00008\"> <h2><a id=\"chap02\">Chapter 2</a></h2><a id=\"chap02\"> <p> We were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in our ages. I need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge. She busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets; and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home —the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons, tempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of our Alpine summers—she found ample scope for admiration and delight. While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their causes. The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine. Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature, gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the earliest sensations I can remember. </p>\n<p> On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native country. We possessed a house in Geneva, and a <i>campagne</i> on Belrive, the eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a league from the city. We resided principally in the latter, and the lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. It was my temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few. I was indifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. Henry Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular talent and fancy. He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for its own sake. He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance. He composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and knightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays and to enter into masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels. </p>\n<p> No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence. We felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families I distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the development of filial love. </p>\n<p> My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits but to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things indiscriminately. I confess that neither the structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states possessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earth that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical, or in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world. </p>\n<p> Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral relations of things. The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes, and the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species. The saintly soul of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home. Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of her celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. She was the living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have become sullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness. And Clerval—could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval? Yet he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his generosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring ambition. </p>\n<p> I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. Besides, in drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events which led, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I would account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my destiny I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost forgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent which, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys. </p>\n<p> Natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire, therefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my predilection for that science. When I was thirteen years of age we all went on a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon; the inclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In this house I chanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful facts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm. A new light seemed to dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated my discovery to my father. My father looked carelessly at the title page of my book and said, “Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear Victor, do not waste your time upon this; it is sad trash.” </p>\n<p> If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while those of the former were real and practical, under such circumstances I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and have contented my imagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my former studies. It is even possible that the train of my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin. But the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents, and I continued to read with the greatest avidity. </p>\n<p> When I returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this author, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me treasures known to few besides myself. I have described myself as always having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature. In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied. Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted appeared even to my boy’s apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same pursuit. </p>\n<p> The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted with their practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little more. He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. He might dissect, anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him. I had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and ignorantly I had repined. </p>\n<p> But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more. I took their word for all that they averred, and I became their disciple. It may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth century; but while I followed the routine of education in the schools of Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with regard to my favourite studies. My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a child’s blindness, added to a student’s thirst for knowledge. Under the guidance of my new preceptors I entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosopher’s stone and the elixir of life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention. Wealth was an inferior object, but what glory would attend the discovery if I could banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death! </p>\n<p> Nor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or devils was a promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors. And thus for a time I was occupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand contradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning, till an accident again changed the current of my ideas. </p>\n<p> When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near Belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm. It advanced from behind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I remained, while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight. As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing remained but a blasted stump. When we visited it the next morning, we found the tree shattered in a singular manner. It was not splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood. I never beheld anything so utterly destroyed. </p>\n<p> Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity. On this occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me. All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies. It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known. All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable. By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps most subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former occupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a would-be science which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledge. In this mood of mind I betook myself to the mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as being built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration. </p>\n<p> Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments are we bound to prosperity or ruin. When I look back, it seems to me as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life—the last effort made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even then hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me. Her victory was announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting studies. It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with their prosecution, happiness with their disregard. </p>\n<p> It was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was ineffectual. Destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and terrible destruction. </p> </a></div>",
      "modern": "<p>Chapter 2</p>\n<p>We grew up together, only a year apart in age. I don’t need to say that we were strangers to any form of conflict or disagreement. Harmony was the essence of our friendship, and the differences in our personalities brought us closer. Elizabeth had a calm and focused nature; in contrast, my passionate spirit drove me to pursue knowledge with fervor. She immersed herself in the ethereal creations of poets, finding endless wonder in the breathtaking landscapes around our Swiss home—the majestic mountains, the changing seasons, the tranquility of winter, and the lively chaos of our Alpine summers. While she observed the stunning beauty of the world with a serious and content heart, I reveled in uncovering the reasons behind it all. The world was a puzzle I longed to solve. My earliest memories are filled with curiosity and joy as I sought to understand the hidden laws of nature.</p>\n<p>When my younger brother was born, seven years after me, my parents settled down, abandoning their wandering lifestyle and establishing roots in our homeland. We had a house in Geneva and a summer home on Belrive, the eastern shore of the lake, about a league from the city. We primarily lived in the latter, and my parents lived a fairly secluded life. I preferred to avoid crowds and form deep connections with a select few. As a result, I was indifferent to most of my classmates, but I formed a close friendship with one of them. Henry Clerval was the son of a Geneva merchant. He was a boy of unique talent and imagination, drawn to adventure, hardship, and even danger for its own sake. He devoured books of chivalry and romance, crafting heroic ballads and writing enchanting tales of knights. He would often try to organize plays and masquerades, where we would dress as heroes from Roncesvalles, the Round Table of King Arthur, and those brave souls who shed blood to reclaim the holy sepulcher from infidels.</p>\n<p>No one could have had a happier childhood than I did. My parents embodied kindness and indulgence. We knew they weren’t tyrants ruling our lives on a whim, but the creators of all the joys we experienced. When I interacted with other families, I clearly saw how fortunate I was, and my gratitude deepened my love for them. I occasionally had a fiery temper and intense passions; however, for some reason, they were directed towards a keen desire to learn, not towards childish distractions. I admit that the intricacies of languages, the structure of governments, or the politics of different nations didn’t interest me. I was eager to uncover the secrets of heaven and earth, whether it concerned the physical substances of things or the deeper essence of nature and the mysterious soul of humanity. My inquiries were aimed at the metaphysical or, in its highest sense, the physical mysteries of the world.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Clerval focused on the moral aspects of life. The vibrant stage of existence, the virtues of heroes, and human actions were his subjects. He dreamed of becoming one of those whose names are forever remembered as gallant and adventurous benefactors of humanity. Elizabeth’s saintly spirit illuminated our peaceful home like a lamp dedicated to a shrine. Her sympathy was our own; her smile, her gentle voice, and the sweet gaze of her celestial eyes were always there to inspire and uplift us. She was the embodiment of love, softening and attracting; I might have become sullen in my studies and rough due to my passionate nature if she hadn’t been there to bring out my gentler side. And Clerval—could anything diminish the noble spirit of Clerval? Yet, I believe he might not have been so kind, so thoughtful in his generosity, or so filled with compassion for others amidst his adventurous spirit had she not revealed to him the true beauty of kindness and made doing good the ultimate goal of his lofty ambitions.</p>\n<p>I find immense joy in reminiscing about my childhood, before misfortune tainted my mind and transformed my bright visions of usefulness into dark and narrow self-reflections. In painting the picture of my early days, I also recount the events that led, insidiously, to my later tale of misery. When I reflect on the origin of that passion which ultimately dictated my fate, I see it arise like a mountain river from humble and almost forgotten beginnings; but as it swelled, it became a torrent that swept away all my hopes and joys. Natural philosophy has been the guiding force of my fate; therefore, I wish to recount the facts that led to my fascination with that science.</p>\n<p>When I was thirteen, we took a trip to the baths near Thonon, but the miserable weather forced us to stay confined to the inn for a day. There, I stumbled upon a book containing the works of Cornelius Agrippa. I initially opened it with indifference, but soon the theories he presented and the astonishing facts he shared ignited my enthusiasm. A new light seemed to dawn in my mind. Overflowing with joy, I rushed to share my discovery with my father. He glanced at the title page and said, “Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear Victor, don’t waste your time on this; it’s nonsense.” If, instead of dismissing it, my father had explained that Agrippa’s principles had been entirely discredited and that a modern scientific approach offered far greater insights than the old one—because the latter was merely fanciful while the former was real and practical—I would have certainly set Agrippa aside and returned to my former studies with renewed vigor. It’s even possible that the course of my thoughts would never have received the fatal push towards ruin.</p>\n<p>However, my father’s casual glance at my book didn’t convince me that he understood its contents, and I continued to read with great eagerness. When I returned home, my first priority was to obtain the complete works of this author, and later of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and absorbed the wild ideas of these writers with delight; they felt like treasures known only to me. I’ve always had a fervent desire to uncover the secrets of nature. Despite the intense work and remarkable discoveries of modern philosophers, I often emerged from my studies feeling discontented and unfulfilled. Sir Isaac Newton is said to have felt like a child picking up seashells beside the vast and unexplored ocean of truth.

I had gazed upon the barriers that seemed to keep humanity from entering the stronghold of nature and foolishly lamented my ignorance. But here were books, and here were individuals who had delved deeper and understood more. I eagerly accepted their words, becoming their disciple.</p>\n<p>It may seem odd that this occurred in the eighteenth century, but while I followed the standard education in the schools of Geneva, I was largely self-taught in my favorite subjects.

Guided by my new mentors, I diligently pursued the philosopher’s stone and the elixir of life; however, my attention soon became fully consumed by the latter. Wealth was of little importance to me, but how glorious it would be to discover a way to eliminate disease from the human body and make humanity invulnerable to anything but violent death!</p>\n<p>These were not my only ambitions. The raising of ghosts or devils was a promise generously offered by my favorite authors, and I eagerly sought to fulfill it; if my attempts were unsuccessful, I blamed my failures on my own inexperience rather than a lack of skill or fidelity in my teachers. Thus, for a time, I became absorbed in outdated systems, mixing together countless contradictory theories and floundering in a slough of diverse knowledge, driven by an eager imagination and childish reasoning, until an accident once again shifted the direction of my thoughts.</p>\n<p>When I was about fifteen, we returned to our home near Belrive, where we witnessed a fierce and terrible thunderstorm.

Suddenly, I saw a stream of fire erupt from an old, beautiful oak about twenty yards from our house; as the dazzling light faded, the oak was gone, leaving only a scorched stump.

But through some twist of fate, the downfall of these men dissuaded me from my usual studies. It felt as if nothing could or would ever be truly known. Everything that had so long captivated my attention suddenly seemed worthless.</p>\n<p>By one of those whims of the mind that we often experience in youth, I immediately abandoned my previous pursuits, dismissed natural history and everything related as a flawed and futile endeavor, and developed a deep disdain for a so-called science that could never even approach real knowledge. In this state of mind, I turned to mathematics and its related fields, believing they rested on solid foundations and were worthy of my attention.</p>\n<p>Such is the strange construction of our souls, and by such fragile ties, we are bound to success or failure. Looking back, it seems to me that this almost miraculous shift in inclination was the last effort of my life’s guardian angel—the final attempt by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was looming in the stars, ready to engulf me. Her victory was marked by an unusual calmness and joy that followed my abandonment of my old, tormenting studies. This was how I was meant to learn to associate evil with their pursuit and happiness with their neglect. It was a strong effort of good, but it was ultimately in vain. Destiny was too powerful, and its unchangeable laws had decreed my utter and terrible destruction.</p>",

      "original": "<div class=\"chapter\" id=\"pgepubid00009\"> <h2><a id=\"chap03\">Chapter 3</a></h2><a id=\"chap03\"> <p> When I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I should become a student at the university of Ingolstadt. I had hitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it necessary for the completion of my education that I should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my native country. My departure was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life occurred—an omen, as it were, of my future misery. </p>\n<p> Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was in the greatest danger. During her illness many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. She had at first yielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her favourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. She attended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity of the distemper—Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this imprudence were fatal to her preserver. On the third day my mother sickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event. On her deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert her. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself. “My children,” she said, “my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union. This expectation will now be the consolation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to my younger children. Alas! I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all? But these are not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.” </p>\n<p> She died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death. I need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the soul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance. It is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed for ever—that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear can be hushed, never more to be heard. These are the reflections of the first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences. Yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connection? And why should I describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? The time at length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a sacrilege, is not banished. My mother was dead, but we had still duties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized. </p>\n<p> My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events, was now again determined upon. I obtained from my father a respite of some weeks. It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose, akin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of life. I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me. I was unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me, and above all, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled. </p>\n<p> She indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all. She looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and zeal. She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call her uncle and cousins. Never was she so enchanting as at this time, when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us. She forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget. </p>\n<p> The day of my departure at length arrived. Clerval spent the last evening with us. He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain. His father was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son. Henry deeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education. He said little, but when he spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details of commerce. </p>\n<p> We sat late. We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor persuade ourselves to say the word “Farewell!” It was said, and we retired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the other was deceived; but when at morning’s dawn I descended to the carriage which was to convey me away, they were all there—my father again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to renew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the last feminine attentions on her playmate and friend. </p>\n<p> I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in the most melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasure—I was now alone. In the university whither I was going I must form my own friends and be my own protector. My life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible repugnance to new countenances. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and Clerval; these were “old familiar faces,” but I believed myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as I commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. I ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at home, thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings. Now my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to repent. </p>\n<p> I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. At length the high white steeple of the town met my eyes. I alighted and was conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased. </p>\n<p> The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to some of the principal professors. Chance—or rather the evil influence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father’s door—led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy. He was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science. He asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy. I replied carelessly, and partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal authors I had studied. The professor stared. “Have you,” he said, “really spent your time in studying such nonsense?” </p>\n<p> I replied in the affirmative. “Every minute,” continued M. Krempe with warmth, “every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost. You have burdened your memory with exploded systems and useless names. Good God! In what desert land have you lived, where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they are ancient? I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific age, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.” </p>\n<p> So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural philosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he omitted. </p>\n<p> I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape. M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in favour of his pursuits. In rather a too philosophical and connected a strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come to concerning them in my early years. As a child I had not been content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural science. With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists. Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy. It was very different when the masters of the science sought immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now the scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was chiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth. </p>\n<p> Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my residence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new abode. But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures. And although I could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M. Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town. </p>\n<p> Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing room, which M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very unlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his temples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black. His person was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard. He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and the various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers. He then took a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of its elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory experiments, he concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I shall never forget: </p>\n<p> “The ancient teachers of this science,” said he, “promised impossibilities and performed nothing. The modern masters promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or crucible, have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her hiding-places. They ascend into the heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of the air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.” </p>\n<p> Such were the professor’s words—rather let me say such the words of the fate—enounced to destroy me. As he went on I felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception, one purpose. So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of Frankenstein—more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation. </p>\n<p> I closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a state of insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I had no power to produce it. By degrees, after the morning’s dawn, sleep came. I awoke, and my yesternight’s thoughts were as a dream. There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a natural talent. On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit. His manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public, for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. I gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had given to his fellow professor. He heard with attention the little narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had exhibited. He said that “These were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. The labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.” I listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours. I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to procure. </p>\n<p> “I am happy,” said M. Waldman, “to have gained a disciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of your success. Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not neglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy, including mathematics.” </p>\n<p> He then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his various machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and promising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in the science not to derange their mechanism. He also gave me the list of books which I had requested, and I took my leave. </p>\n<p> Thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny. </p> </a></div>",
      "modern": "<p>CHAPTER 3</p>\n<p>When I turned seventeen, my parents decided I should become a student at the University of Ingolstadt. Until then, I had attended schools in Geneva, but my father believed it was important for me to experience customs beyond those of my homeland. My departure was set for an early date, but before that day arrived, the first tragedy of my life struck—an omen, as it were, of the misery that lay ahead. Elizabeth had caught scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was in grave danger.</p>\n<p>During her sickness, many urged my mother not to attend to her. At first, she complied with our pleas, but when she learned that Elizabeth’s life was at stake, she could no longer suppress her anxiety. She stayed by Elizabeth’s bedside; her vigilant care overcame the severity of the illness—Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this recklessness were fatal for my mother. On the third day, my mother fell ill; her fever brought alarming symptoms, and the expressions of her doctors foretold the worst outcome. Even on her deathbed, the strength and kindness of this wonderful woman did not abandon her. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and me. “My children,” she said, “my greatest hopes for future happiness rested on your union. This hope will now be a comfort to your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must take my place with your younger siblings. Oh, how I regret being taken from you! And, as happy and loved as I have been, is it not cruel to leave you all? But such thoughts are unfit for me; I will try to accept death cheerfully and will hold onto the hope of meeting you again in another world.” She passed away peacefully, and even in death, her face showed love.</p>\n<p>I need not describe the anguish of those whose closest bonds are shattered by the irreparable loss—the emptiness that fills the soul and the despair etched on their faces. It takes a long time for the mind to accept that the person we saw every day, whose existence felt like a part of our own, is gone forever—that the light in a beloved eye has been snuffed out and the familiar sound of a cherished voice is silenced, never to be heard again. These are the thoughts that occupy the early days of mourning; but as time reveals the reality of the loss, the true bitterness of grief begins. Yet, who among us hasn’t had that cruel hand rip away someone dear? And why should I recount a sorrow that everyone has felt and must feel?</p>\n<p>Eventually, the time comes when grief becomes more of an indulgence than a necessity, and the smile that appears on our lips, though it may seem sacrilegious, is not banished. My mother was gone, but we still had responsibilities to fulfill; we must continue our lives and learn to feel fortunate while we still have one another, untouched by death. My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been postponed due to these events, was now rescheduled. I received a few weeks’ reprieve from my father. It felt wrong to leave the somber tranquility of our household, akin to death, and plunge into the chaos of life. I was new to sorrow, but it still alarmed me. I was hesitant to part from those who remained, and above all, I wanted to see my sweet Elizabeth somewhat consoled.</p>\n<p>She indeed masked her grief and tried to comfort us all. She faced life with courage and enthusiasm, dedicating herself to those she had learned to call her uncle and cousins. Never had she been more enchanting than at that time, when she brought back the sunshine of her smiles and shared them with us. She even set aside her own sorrow to help us forget ours. Finally, the day of my departure arrived. Clerval spent the last evening with us. He had tried to persuade his father to let him accompany me as my fellow student, but without success. His father was a narrow-minded trader who viewed his son’s aspirations and ambitions as idleness and ruin. Henry felt deeply the misfortune of being denied a liberal education. He said little, but when he spoke, I could see the determined light in his eyes—a quiet resolve not to be chained to the miserable details of commerce.</p>\n<p>We lingered late into the night, unable to tear ourselves away from one another or to say the word “Farewell!” It was finally said, and we withdrew under the pretense of seeking rest, each believing the other was fooled; but when dawn broke, I went down to the carriage that would take me away, and they were all there—my father to bless me again, Clerval to shake my hand one last time, and Elizabeth to renew her pleas that I would write often and to offer her last tender attentions to her playmate and friend. I threw myself into the carriage that would take me away and succumbed to the most melancholy reflections. I, who had always been surrounded by kind companions, constantly engaged in seeking mutual happiness—I was now alone. At the university I was heading to, I would have to make my own friends and be my own protector.</p>\n<p>My life had been remarkably sheltered and domestic, leaving me with a strong aversion to new faces. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and Clerval; they were “old familiar faces,” but I felt totally unprepared for the company of strangers. These were my thoughts as I began my journey; but as I traveled, my spirits and hopes lifted. I yearned for knowledge. I had often thought it hard to remain cooped up in one place during my youth and had longed to enter the world and take my place among others. Now my desires were being fulfilled, and it would indeed have been foolish to regret it.</p>\n<p>I had plenty of time for these and many other reflections during my long, exhausting journey to Ingolstadt. At last, I caught sight of the tall white steeple of the town. I disembarked and was shown to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I wished. The next morning, I delivered my letters of introduction and visited some of the leading professors. Chance—or rather the evil influence, the Angel of Destruction, that had exerted its power over me since I reluctantly left my father’s door—led me first to M. Krempe, the professor of natural philosophy. He was an awkward man, but deeply knowledgeable in his field. He asked me several questions about my progress in various scientific disciplines related to natural philosophy. I responded carelessly and, partly in disdain, mentioned the names of the alchemists as the main authors I had studied. The professor stared at me.</p>\n<p>“Have you,” he said, “really spent your time studying such nonsense?” I confirmed that I had. “Every minute,” M. Krempe continued passionately, “every instant you have wasted on those books is utterly lost. You have filled your mind with outdated theories and useless names. Good God! In what forsaken place have you lived, where no one was kind enough to tell you that these fanciful ideas you've so eagerly absorbed are a thousand years old and as stale as they are ancient? I never expected, in this enlightened and scientific age, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear sir, you must start your studies entirely anew.”</p>\n<p>With that, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of books on natural philosophy that he wanted me to obtain, dismissing me with the note that he intended to start a course of lectures on natural philosophy in its general relations the following week, and that M. Waldman, another professor, would lecture on chemistry on alternate days. I returned home not disappointed, as I had long considered those authors useless whom the professor condemned; but I was not at all inclined to return to these studies in any form. M. Krempe was a short man with a gruff voice and an unattractive face, so the teacher did not endear me to his field.</p>\n<p>In a somewhat too philosophical and coherent manner, perhaps, I have recounted the conclusions I had come to about these topics in my early years. As a child, I had not been satisfied with the results promised by modern professors of natural science. With a jumble of ideas that can only be explained by my extreme youth and lack of guidance, I had retraced the steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the discoveries of recent scholars for the dreams of forgotten alchemists. Additionally, I held contempt for the practical applications of modern natural philosophy. It was different when the masters of science sought immortality and power; such ambitions, though futile, were grand; but now the focus had shifted. The ambition of the inquirer seemed limited to dismissing those visions that had fueled my interest in science. I was being asked to exchange lofty fantasies for trivial realities.</p>\n<p>These were my reflections during the first two or three days of my stay in Ingolstadt, which I mostly spent familiarizing myself with the area and the key residents of my new home. But as the following week began, I recalled the information M. Krempe had given me about the lectures. And even though I couldn’t bring myself to go and listen to that little arrogant man deliver his words from the podium, I remembered what he had said about M. Waldman, whom I had yet to see, as he had been out of town. Partly out of curiosity and partly from idleness, I entered the lecture room, where M. Waldman arrived shortly after.</p>\n<p>This professor was very different from his colleague. He appeared to be about fifty years old, but his face expressed the utmost kindness; a few gray hairs adorned his temples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black. He was short but remarkably upright, and his voice was the sweetest I had ever heard. He began his lecture by summarizing the history of chemistry and the various advancements made by different scholars, passionately pronouncing the names of the most distinguished discoverers. Then he took a brief look at the current state of the science and explained many of its basic terms. After performing a few preliminary experiments, he concluded with a tribute to modern chemistry, the words of which I shall never forget: “The ancient teachers of this science,” he said, “promised impossibilities and achieved nothing. The modern masters promise very little; they understand that metals cannot be transformed and that the elixir of life is a chimera. Yet these philosophers, whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt and whose eyes to peer into microscopes or crucibles, have indeed performed miracles. They delve into the hidden secrets of nature and reveal how she operates in her concealed realms. They ascend to the heavens; they have discovered how blood circulates and the nature of the air we breathe. They have gained new and almost limitless powers; they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic earthquakes, and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.”</p>\n<p>Such were the professor’s words—or rather, such were the words of fate—uttered to lead me to my destruction. As he spoke, I felt as though my soul was wrestling with a tangible enemy; one by one, the various keys were touched that formed the mechanism of my being; one chord after another was struck, and soon my mind was filled with a singular thought, a singular vision, a singular purpose. So much has been achieved, exclaimed the soul of Frankenstein—more, far more, will I accomplish; following the path already laid out, I will carve a new way, explore unknown powers, and reveal to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.</p>\n<p>I did not close my eyes that night. My inner self was in a state of rebellion and chaos; I felt that order would eventually arise, but I had no power to create it. Gradually, after the dawn, sleep came. I awoke, and the thoughts of the previous night felt like a dream. The only thing that remained was a resolution to return to my former studies and dedicate myself to a science I believed I had a natural gift for. That same day, I visited M. Waldman. His demeanor in private was even more gentle and appealing than in public, for during his lectures, a certain dignity marked his presence, while in his own home, he was warm and approachable.</p>\n<p>I recounted to him nearly the same story of my previous studies as I had shared with his fellow professor. He listened attentively to my brief narrative about my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the disdain that M. Krempe had shown. He said, “These were men to whom modern philosophers owe most of the foundations of their knowledge. They have left us with the easier task of renaming and organizing the facts they largely brought to light. The efforts of great minds, however misguided, rarely fail to benefit humanity in the end.” I listened to his remarks, delivered without arrogance or pretension, and then added that his lecture had changed my views about modern chemists; I expressed myself carefully, with the humility and respect due to a youth in the presence of his mentor, without revealing (my inexperience in life would have made me embarrassed) any of the enthusiasm that fueled my intended work. I asked for his advice on which books I should obtain.</p>\n<p>“I am glad,” said M. Waldman, “to have gained a disciple; and if your dedication matches your talent, I have no doubt you will succeed. Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy where the greatest advancements have been made and can still be made; that’s why I have made it my primary focus. However, I have not neglected other fields of study. A man would be a poor chemist if he focused solely on that area of human knowledge. If your goal is to genuinely become a scientist and not just a petty experimenter, I recommend you engage with every branch of natural philosophy, including mathematics.”</p>\n<p>He then took me into his laboratory and explained the uses of his various instruments, guiding me on what I should acquire and promising me access to his own equipment when I advanced far enough in the science not to disrupt their mechanisms. He also provided me with the list of books I had requested, and I took my leave. Thus ended a day that would be momentous for me; it determined my future destiny.</p>",

      "original": "<div class=\"chapter\" id=\"pgepubid00010\"> <h2><a id=\"chap04\">Chapter 4</a></h2><a id=\"chap04\"> <p> From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the most comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation. I read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination, which modern inquirers have written on these subjects. I attended the lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the university, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive physiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable. In M. Waldman I found a true friend. His gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and good nature that banished every idea of pedantry. In a thousand ways he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension. My application was at first fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the light of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory. </p>\n<p> As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress was rapid. My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and my proficiency that of the masters. Professor Krempe often asked me, with a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress. Two years passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I hoped to make. None but those who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements of science. In other studies you go as far as others have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder. A mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was solely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two years I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical instruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the university. When I had arrived at this point and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought of returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident happened that protracted my stay. </p>\n<p> One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with life. Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed? It was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our inquiries. I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy which relate to physiology. Unless I had been animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this study would have been irksome and almost intolerable. To examine the causes of life, we must first have recourse to death. I became acquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body. In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared the apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become food for the worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnel-houses. My attention was fixed upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain. I paused, examining and analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change from life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant and wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same science, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a secret. </p>\n<p> Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun does not more certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is true. Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the discovery were distinct and probable. After days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of generation and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter. </p>\n<p> The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery soon gave place to delight and rapture. After so much time spent in painful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the most gratifying consummation of my toils. But this discovery was so great and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been progressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result. What had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation of the world was now within my grasp. Not that, like a magic scene, it all opened upon me at once: the information I had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already accomplished. I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead and found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly ineffectual light. </p>\n<p> I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with which I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end of my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that subject. I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was, to your destruction and infallible misery. Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow. </p>\n<p> When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated a long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it. Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable difficulty and labour. I doubted at first whether I should attempt the creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful as man. The materials at present within my command hardly appeared adequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should ultimately succeed. I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be imperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success. Nor could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any argument of its impracticability. It was with these feelings that I began the creation of a human being. As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say, about eight feet in height, and proportionably large. After having formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully collecting and arranging my materials, I began. </p>\n<p> No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. Life and death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and pour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new species would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve theirs. Pursuing these reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible) renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption. </p>\n<p> These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking with unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and my person had become emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might realise. One secret which I alone possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon gazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places. Who shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay? My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. It was indeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had returned to my old habits. I collected bones from charnel-houses and disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human frame. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house, and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase, I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from their sockets in attending to the details of my employment. The dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials; and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I brought my work near to a conclusion. </p>\n<p> The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in one pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature. And the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had not seen for so long a time. I knew my silence disquieted them, and I well remembered the words of my father: “I know that while you are pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall hear regularly from you. You must pardon me if I regard any interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties are equally neglected.” </p>\n<p> I knew well therefore what would be my father’s feelings, but I could not tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. I wished, as it were, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature, should be completed. </p>\n<p> I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect to vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was justified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from blame. A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human mind. If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections, Greece had not been enslaved, Cæsar would have spared his country, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed. </p>\n<p> But I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my tale, and your looks remind me to proceed. </p>\n<p> My father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my silence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before. Winter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not watch the blossom or the expanding leaves—sights which before always yielded me supreme delight—so deeply was I engrossed in my occupation. The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near to a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had succeeded. But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment. Every night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most painful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime. Sometimes I grew alarmed at the wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose alone sustained me: my labours would soon end, and I believed that exercise and amusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I promised myself both of these when my creation should be complete. </p> </a></div>",
      "modern": "<p>CHAPTER 4</p>\n<p>From that day on, my focus shifted almost entirely to natural philosophy, particularly chemistry in its broadest sense. I eagerly read the works of modern scholars who approached these subjects with such insight and creativity. I attended lectures and formed connections with the scientists at the university. Even M. Krempe, despite his unappealing appearance and manner, proved to be a source of valuable knowledge. In contrast, M. Waldman became a true friend. His gentle approach was free from dogmatism, and he taught with a sincerity and kindness that made every lesson enjoyable. He helped me navigate complex ideas, making even the most challenging concepts clear and accessible.</p>\n<p>At first, my commitment to my studies fluctuated, but it soon became intense and passionate. I lost track of time in the laboratory, often working until dawn while the stars faded in the morning light. Given my relentless dedication, I made rapid progress. My enthusiasm astonished my fellow students, and my proficiency impressed the professors. Professor Krempe would often ask me, with a sly smile, how my studies of Cornelius Agrippa were going, while M. Waldman expressed genuine joy in my achievements.</p>\n<p>Two years passed in this way, during which I didn’t return to Geneva, wholly absorbed in pursuing discoveries I hoped to make. Only those who have experienced the allure of science can understand its temptations. In other fields, you reach a limit defined by what others have already learned, but in science, there is always more to uncover and marvel at. A mind of average ability that focuses intently on one subject will inevitably achieve great expertise, and I, who was singularly devoted, advanced so quickly that, by the end of two years, I had made significant improvements to certain chemical instruments, earning me considerable respect at the university.</p>\n<p>Once I reached a level of understanding in natural philosophy comparable to what any professor at Ingolstadt could provide, I felt it was time to return to my friends and hometown. However, an event occurred that extended my stay. One area that particularly fascinated me was the structure of the human body, and indeed, any living creature. I often pondered: where does the principle of life originate? It was a bold question, shrouded in mystery, yet how many discoveries lie just beyond our grasp if not for our fears or neglect? I contemplated these questions and resolved to focus my studies on the branches of natural philosophy related to physiology.</p>\n<p>Had it not been for an almost supernatural passion, my pursuit of this study would have felt tedious and unbearable. To understand the causes of life, one must first consider death. I delved into anatomy, but that alone was not enough; I also needed to observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body. My father had taken great care to shield me from supernatural horrors during my upbringing. I never remember being afraid of ghost stories or the idea of spirits. Darkness held no terror for me, and a graveyard was merely a place where bodies, once full of life and beauty, had become food for worms.</p>\n<p>Now, however, I found myself compelled to investigate the causes and processes of decay, spending countless days and nights in vaults and charnel-houses. My focus zeroed in on the most distressing aspects of human existence. I witnessed the degradation of the human form, the bloom of life giving way to the corruption of death, and how the wonders of the eye and brain became the inheritance of worms. I scrutinized every detail of the transition from life to death and back again, until, from the depths of this darkness, a sudden light broke through—a light so brilliant and astonishing, yet so simple, that while I felt dizzy from the vastness of the insight it offered, I was astonished that, among so many brilliant minds who had pursued the same science, I alone had been chosen to unveil such a remarkable secret.</p>\n<p>I assure you, I am not recounting the delusions of a madman. The sun shines in the sky just as surely as the truth I now declare. Some miracle might have facilitated it, yet the steps toward my discovery were clear and logical. After days and nights of relentless effort, I uncovered the cause of generation and life; indeed, I became capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter. The initial astonishment I felt shifted to joy and elation. After all my labor, achieving the pinnacle of my ambitions was the most fulfilling culmination of my efforts. Yet this discovery was so immense and overwhelming that all the steps I took to reach it faded from memory, leaving me only with the outcome. What had been the pursuit of the wisest men since the dawn of time was now within my reach.</p>\n<p>Not that it all revealed itself to me in an instant; the knowledge I gained was more about guiding my efforts toward the object of my quest than presenting that object fully formed. I felt like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead and found a way back to life, aided only by a faint and seemingly ineffective light. I see from your eagerness and the wonder in your eyes, my friend, that you expect me to share my secret; I cannot do that now. Please listen patiently until I finish my story, and you will understand why I am reluctant to discuss it. I will not lead you, unguarded and passionate as I once was, to your own destruction and inevitable misery.</p>\n<p>Learn from me, if not through my teachings, then at least through my experiences, how perilous the pursuit of knowledge can be, and how much happier is the person who believes his hometown is the entire world than the one who strives to exceed the limits of human capacity. When I discovered such astonishing power within my grasp, I hesitated for a long time about how to use it. Although I had the ability to give life, the challenge of preparing a body to receive it—with all its complex fibers, muscles, and veins—remained an enormous task. I initially wondered whether I should attempt to create a being like myself or one of simpler design, but my imagination was too exhilarated by my early success to doubt my ability to bring to life something as complex and remarkable as a human being.</p>\n<p>The materials at my disposal seemed inadequate for such a formidable endeavor, but I had faith that I would eventually succeed. I prepared for numerous setbacks; my efforts could be constantly thwarted, and ultimately my work might be flawed. Yet, considering the advancements in science and mechanics that occur daily, I felt hopeful that my current attempts would at least lay the groundwork for future success. I did not see the scale and complexity of my plan as an argument against its feasibility. With these thoughts in mind, I began the creation of a human being.</p>\n<p>Because the intricacy of the parts slowed my progress, I resolved, contrary to my initial intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature—about eight feet tall and proportionately large. After months spent gathering and organizing my materials, I began my work. No one can imagine the range of emotions that propelled me forward like a hurricane in the first rush of success. Life and death seemed like boundaries I was meant to break, and I envisioned pouring light into our dark world. A new species would see me as its creator, and many happy and wonderful beings would owe their existence to me. No father could deserve the gratitude of a child more than I would deserve theirs.</p>\n<p>As I followed these reflections, I considered that if I could breathe life into lifeless matter, I might eventually (though I currently found it impossible) restore life to bodies that death had seemingly claimed. These thoughts uplifted my spirits as I pursued my work with unwavering intensity. My cheeks grew pale from study, and I became gaunt from confinement. Sometimes, just when I felt close to a breakthrough, I would falter; yet, I still clung to the hope that the next day or even the next hour might fulfill my ambitions. The one secret I possessed was the hope I had dedicated myself to, and the moon watched over my midnight labors as I pursued nature into her hiding places.</p>\n<p>Who can truly understand the horrors of my secret toil as I worked amidst the unholy dampness of graves or tortured living animals to animate lifeless clay? My limbs tremble now, and my eyes fill with tears at the memories, but at that time, an irresistible and almost frantic impulse pushed me on, and I felt as though I had lost all sense of self except for this one pursuit. It was indeed a fleeting trance, one that made me acutely aware as soon as the unnatural urge faded and I returned to my usual habits. I gathered bones from charnel-houses and disturbed, with profane hands, the profound secrets of the human body.</p>\n<p>In a solitary room, or rather a small cell, at the top of the house, separated from all other rooms by a staircase and gallery, I maintained my workshop of grotesque creation. My eyes bulged from their sockets as I focused on the details of my task. The dissecting room and slaughterhouse supplied many of my materials, and often my humanity recoiled at the nature of my work, yet driven by an ever-increasing eagerness, I brought my creation closer to completion. The summer months passed as I was consumed, heart and soul, by this single pursuit. It was a beautiful season; never had the fields yielded a more abundant harvest or the vines produced a more luscious vintage, yet my eyes were blind to the beauty of nature.</p>\n<p>The same feelings that made me neglect the world around me also caused me to forget the friends who were so far away, and whom I had not seen in such a long time. I knew my silence troubled them, and I remembered my father’s words: “I know that while you are pleased with yourself, you will think of us fondly, and we will hear from you regularly. You must forgive me if I see any interruption in your correspondence as a sign that you are neglecting your other duties.” I understood well how my father would feel, but I could not pull my thoughts from my loathsome work, which had taken an unyielding hold of my imagination. I wished, in a way, to postpone all matters of affection until I completed the great objective that consumed every habit of my being.</p>\n<p>I thought my father would be unjust to attribute my neglect to vice or faults on my part, but I now recognize he was right to think that I couldn’t escape blame. A truly perfect human being should always maintain a calm and peaceful mind, never allowing passion or fleeting desires to disturb their tranquility. I don’t believe the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule. If the study to which you dedicate yourself weakens your affections and erodes your appreciation for life’s simple pleasures, then that study is certainly inappropriate, unworthy of the human mind. If this principle were always upheld—if no man allowed any pursuit to interfere with the peace of his domestic affections—Greece would not have been enslaved, Caesar would have spared his country, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the empires of Mexico and Peru would not have been destroyed.</p>\n<p>But I realize I am moralizing at the most intriguing part of my tale, and your expressions remind me to continue. My father made no accusations in his letters, merely acknowledging my silence by inquiring more deeply into my activities. Winter, spring, and summer passed during my labors; I did not notice the blossoms or the budding leaves—sights that had always filled me with joy—so absorbed was I in my work. The leaves of that year had withered before my project neared completion, and each passing day made it clearer how well I was succeeding. Yet my enthusiasm was tempered by anxiety, and I felt more like a slave laboring in a mine or another unhealthy trade than an artist devoted to his passion.</p>\n<p>Every night, I was weighed down by a slow fever, and I became extremely nervous; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I avoided human contact as if I had committed a crime. Sometimes, I would be horrified at the wreck I had become; only the strength of my purpose kept me going. I believed my labors would soon conclude, and that exercise and relaxation would then cure my encroaching illness; I promised myself both once my creation was complete.</p>",

      "original": "<div class=\"chapter\" id=\"pgepubid00011\"> <h2><a id=\"chap05\">Chapter 5</a></h2><a id=\"chap05\"> <p> It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment of my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs. </p>\n<p> How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips. </p>\n<p> The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had deprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart. Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep. At length lassitude succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness. But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest dreams. I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in the streets of Ingolstadt. Delighted and surprised, I embraced her, but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel. I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window shutters, I beheld the wretch—the miserable monster whom I had created. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they may be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs. I took refuge in the courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I had so miserably given life. </p>\n<p> Oh! No mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I had gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing such as even Dante could not have conceived. </p>\n<p> I passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and hardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness. Mingled with this horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete! </p>\n<p> Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my sleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple and clock, which indicated the sixth hour. The porter opened the gates of the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my view. I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but felt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured from a black and comfortless sky. </p>\n<p> I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I traversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or what I was doing. My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and I hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me: </p> <p class=\"poem\"> Like one who, on a lonely road,<br> Doth walk in fear and dread,<br> And, having once turned round, walks on,<br> And turns no more his head;<br> Because he knows a frightful fiend<br> Doth close behind him tread.<br> <br> [Coleridge’s “Ancient Mariner.”] </p>\n<p> Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various diligences and carriages usually stopped. Here I paused, I knew not why; but I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming towards me from the other end of the street. As it drew nearer I observed that it was the Swiss diligence; it stopped just where I was standing, and on the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me, instantly sprung out. “My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed he, “how glad I am to see you! How fortunate that you should be here at the very moment of my alighting!” </p>\n<p> Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought back to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear to my recollection. I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror and misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months, calm and serene joy. I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial manner, and we walked towards my college. Clerval continued talking for some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being permitted to come to Ingolstadt. “You may easily believe,” said he, “how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping; and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch schoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield: ‘I have ten thousand florins a year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.’ But his affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of knowledge.” </p>\n<p> “It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left my father, brothers, and Elizabeth.” </p>\n<p> “Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from you so seldom. By the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon their account myself. But, my dear Frankenstein,” continued he, stopping short and gazing full in my face, “I did not before remark how very ill you appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for several nights.” </p>\n<p> “You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one occupation that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see; but I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an end and that I am at length free.” </p>\n<p> I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to allude to, the occurrences of the preceding night. I walked with a quick pace, and we soon arrived at my college. I then reflected, and the thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my apartment might still be there, alive and walking about. I dreaded to behold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him. Entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs, I darted up towards my own room. My hand was already on the lock of the door before I recollected myself. I then paused, and a cold shivering came over me. I threw the door forcibly open, as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared. I stepped fearfully in: the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed from its hideous guest. I could hardly believe that so great a good fortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval. </p>\n<p> We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast; but I was unable to contain myself. It was not joy only that possessed me; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse beat rapidly. I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same place; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud. Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival, but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes for which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless laughter frightened and astonished him. </p>\n<p> “My dear Victor,” cried he, “what, for God’s sake, is the matter? Do not laugh in that manner. How ill you are! What is the cause of all this?” </p>\n<p> “Do not ask me,” cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I thought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; “<i>he</i> can tell. Oh, save me! Save me!” I imagined that the monster seized me; I struggled furiously and fell down in a fit. </p>\n<p> Poor Clerval! What must have been his feelings? A meeting, which he anticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness. But I was not the witness of his grief, for I was lifeless and did not recover my senses for a long, long time. </p>\n<p> This was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for several months. During all that time Henry was my only nurse. I afterwards learned that, knowing my father’s advanced age and unfitness for so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make Elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my disorder. He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest action that he could towards them. </p>\n<p> But I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life. The form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever before my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my words surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event. </p>\n<p> By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and grieved my friend, I recovered. I remember the first time I became capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window. It was a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence. I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion. </p>\n<p> “Dearest Clerval,” exclaimed I, “how kind, how very good you are to me. This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you promised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room. How shall I ever repay you? I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I have been the occasion, but you will forgive me.” </p>\n<p> “You will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself, but get well as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I may speak to you on one subject, may I not?” </p>\n<p> I trembled. One subject! What could it be? Could he allude to an object on whom I dared not even think? </p>\n<p> “Compose yourself,” said Clerval, who observed my change of colour, “I will not mention it if it agitates you; but your father and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your own handwriting. They hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at your long silence.” </p>\n<p> “Is that all, my dear Henry? How could you suppose that my first thought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love and who are so deserving of my love?” </p>\n<p> “If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you; it is from your cousin, I believe.” </p> </a></div>",
      "modern": "<p>CHAPTER 5</p>\n<p>It was a bleak night in November when I witnessed the culmination of my efforts. With a sense of anxiety that bordered on agony, I gathered the instruments of life around me, preparing to infuse a spark of existence into the lifeless form at my feet. It was already past one in the morning; the rain pattered drearily against the windows, and my candle was nearly burnt out when, through the flickering light, I saw the creature's dull yellow eye open. It gasped for air, and a convulsive motion shook its limbs. How can I describe the turmoil within me at this moment, or how can I portray the wretch I had worked so tirelessly to create? His limbs were proportionate, and I had chosen his features to be beautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin barely concealed the muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was a lustrous black, flowing freely; his teeth were pearly white. Yet these features only highlighted the horrific contrast with his watery eyes, which seemed almost the same color as the dull white sockets they were set in, his shriveled complexion, and his straight black lips. The unpredictable nature of life is not as fickle as the emotions of human beings. I had labored for nearly two years, driven by the singular goal of bringing life to an inanimate body. In pursuit of this, I had sacrificed my rest and health. I had desired it with a fervor that far exceeded reason; but now that it was complete, the beauty of my dream faded, replaced by breathless horror and disgust that filled my heart. Unable to bear the sight of the being I had created, I fled the room and spent a long time pacing my bedroom, unable to calm my mind enough to sleep. Eventually, exhaustion took over the chaos I had endured, and I collapsed onto my bed, still dressed, hoping for a few moments of forgetfulness. But it was in vain; I did sleep, yet I was plagued by the wildest dreams. I thought I saw Elizabeth, vibrant and healthy, walking through the streets of Ingolstadt. Overjoyed and surprised, I embraced her, but as I pressed my lips to hers, they turned livid, the color of death; her features shifted, and I believed I was holding the corpse of my deceased mother in my arms, shrouded and infested with grave-worms crawling in the folds of the fabric. I awoke with a start, horror-stricken; a cold sweat covered my forehead, my teeth chattered, and every limb was convulsed. Then, by the dim yellow light of the moon filtering through the window shutters, I saw the wretch—the miserable monster that I had created. He pulled back the curtain of the bed, and his eyes, if they could be called eyes, were fixed on me. His mouth opened, and he mumbled incoherent sounds while a grin twisted his cheeks. He might have spoken, but I didn’t hear him; one hand reached out, seemingly to stop me, but I broke free and dashed downstairs. I took refuge in the courtyard of the house where I lived, pacing back and forth in great agitation, listening intently, jumping at every sound as if it announced the approach of the monstrous corpse I had so wretchedly brought to life. Oh! No mortal could endure the horror of that countenance. A mummy revived with animation could not be as hideous as that wretch. I had seen him before he was animated; he had been ugly then, but once those muscles and joints were capable of motion, he became something even Dante could not have imagined. I spent the night in misery. Sometimes my pulse raced so quickly that I could feel the pounding of every artery; at other times, I nearly collapsed from fatigue and extreme weakness. Along with this horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had been my sustenance and comfort had turned into a hell for me, and the shift was so rapid, the downfall so complete! Morning, bleak and rainy, finally broke, revealing to my sleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, with its white steeple and clock indicating six o'clock. The porter opened the courtyard gates, which had been my refuge that night, and I stepped into the streets, walking quickly as if trying to evade the wretch I feared might appear at every corner. I didn’t dare return to my apartment but felt compelled to keep moving, even as the rain poured down from a dark and unwelcoming sky. I walked like this for some time, trying to ease the burden on my mind through physical exertion. I wandered the streets without any clear sense of direction or purpose. My heart raced with fear, and I hurried on, taking irregular steps, too frightened to look around me:</p>\n<p>Like someone on a lonely road,  \nWalking in fear and dread,  \nAnd having once turned around,  \nKeeps going without turning his head;  \nBecause he knows a frightful fiend  \nIs close behind him tread.</p>\n<p>Continuing like this, I eventually found myself in front of the inn where various stagecoaches and carriages usually stopped. Here I paused, not knowing why, but I stood for several minutes staring at a coach approaching me from the other end of the street. As it drew closer, I recognized it as the Swiss diligence; it stopped right where I stood, and when the door opened, I saw Henry Clerval, who, upon seeing me, immediately jumped out.</p>\n<p>“My dear Frankenstein,” he exclaimed, “how wonderful to see you! What luck that you should be here just as I arrive!”</p>\n<p>Nothing could compare to my joy at seeing Clerval; his presence brought back memories of my father, Elizabeth, and all those cherished scenes from home. I took his hand, and in that moment, I forgot my horror and misfortune; I felt suddenly, for the first time in many months, a sense of calm and joy. I welcomed my friend warmly, and we walked toward my college. Clerval continued talking for a while about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in coming to Ingolstadt.</p>\n<p>“You can easily imagine,” he said, “how difficult it was to convince my father that all necessary knowledge isn’t encompassed by the noble art of bookkeeping; indeed, I believe I left him doubtful until the end, for his constant reply to my relentless pleas was the same as that of the Dutch schoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield: ‘I have ten thousand florins a year without Greek; I eat well without Greek.’ But his love for me eventually overcame his disdain for learning, and he allowed me to undertake a journey of discovery to the land of knowledge.”</p>\n<p>“It brings me great joy to see you; but tell me how my father, brothers, and Elizabeth are.”</p>\n<p>“They are very well and quite happy, only a little anxious that they hear from you so seldom. By the way, I plan to lecture you a bit about that myself. But, my dear Frankenstein,” he said, stopping abruptly and gazing intently at my face, “I didn’t realize before how ill you look; so thin and pale. You seem as if you haven’t slept for several nights.”</p>\n<p>“You guessed right; I have been so deeply engaged in one project that I haven’t allowed myself enough rest, as you can see. But I hope, I truly hope, that all these efforts are now over and that I am finally free.”</p>\n<p>I trembled at these words; I couldn’t bear to think about, let alone mention, what had happened the night before. I walked quickly, and we soon arrived at my college. Then I thought, and the idea made me shiver, that the creature I had left in my apartment might still be there, alive and moving around. I dreaded the thought of seeing this monster, but I feared even more that Henry would see him. Therefore, I asked him to wait for a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs while I darted up to my room. My hand was already on the door lock when I hesitated. I paused, and a cold shiver ran through me. I threw the door open forcefully, like a child expecting to find a ghost waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared. I stepped inside cautiously: the room was empty, and my bedroom was also free of its hideous occupant. I could hardly believe that such great fortune had come to me, but when I confirmed that my enemy had indeed fled, I clapped my hands in joy and ran back down to Clerval.</p>\n<p>We went back up to my room, and the servant soon brought breakfast, but I couldn't contain myself. It wasn’t just joy that filled me; I felt a tingling sensitivity in my flesh, and my pulse raced. I couldn’t stay still for a moment; I jumped over chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed out loud. Initially, Clerval attributed my unusual excitement to joy over his arrival, but when he looked at me closely, he noticed a wildness in my eyes that he couldn’t explain, and my loud, uncontrolled laughter frightened and astonished him.</p>\n<p>“My dear Victor,” he exclaimed, “what on earth is the matter? Don’t laugh like that. You look so ill! What’s causing all of this?”</p>\n<p>“Don’t ask me,” I cried, covering my eyes, as I thought I saw the dreaded specter glide into the room; “he can tell. Oh, save me! Save me!”</p>\n<p>I imagined the monster grabbing me; I struggled fiercely and collapsed into a fit. Poor Clerval! What must he have felt? A reunion, which he had anticipated with such joy, had turned so strangely into bitterness. But I wasn’t aware of his grief, for I was lifeless and didn’t regain my senses for a long, long time. This marked the beginning of a nervous fever that kept me bedridden for several months. During that time, Henry was my only caregiver. I later learned that he, knowing my father’s advanced age and unfitness for such a long journey, and understanding how miserable my illness would make Elizabeth, sheltered them from this grief by hiding the extent of my condition. He believed that he could not have a kinder or more attentive nurse than himself; and firm in his hope for my recovery, he was convinced that instead of causing harm, he was doing the kindest thing possible for them. But I was genuinely very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and constant care of my friend could have brought me back to life. The image of the monster I had brought into existence lingered constantly in my mind, and I raved incessantly about him. Undoubtedly, my words surprised Henry; he initially thought they were just the ramblings of a disturbed mind, but the persistence with which I returned to the same topic convinced him that my illness stemmed from some unusual and terrible event. Gradually, with frequent setbacks that worried and saddened my friend, I began to recover. I remember the first time I was able to notice the outside world with any semblance of pleasure; I saw that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that young buds were starting to bloom on the trees that shaded my window. It was a beautiful spring, and the season greatly aided my recovery. I also felt feelings of joy and affection rekindle in my heart; my gloom faded, and soon I was cheerful once again, as I had been before I was consumed by that fatal obsession.</p>\n<p>“Dearest Clerval,” I exclaimed, “how kind and good you are to me. This entire winter, which you had promised to spend in study, has instead been consumed in my sickroom. How can I ever repay you? I feel immense remorse for the disappointment I have caused, but you will forgive me.”</p>\n<p>“You will repay me entirely if you don’t distress yourself, but get well as quickly as you can; and since you seem to be in good spirits, may I speak to you about one subject?”</p>\n<p>I trembled. One subject! What could it be? Could he be referring to something I dared not even think about?</p>\n<p>“Calm yourself,” said Clerval, noticing my change of color, “I won’t mention it if it troubles you; but your father and cousin would be very happy to receive a letter from you in your own handwriting. They hardly know how ill you have been, and they are anxious about your long silence.”</p>\n<p>“Is that all, my dear Henry? How could you think that my first thought wouldn’t fly to those dear friends I love, who deserve my love?”</p>\n<p>“If this is your current mood, my friend, you might be glad to see a letter that has been lying here for a few days for you; it’s from your cousin, I believe.”</p>",

It was from my own Elizabeth: </p> <p class=\"letter\"> “My dearest Cousin, </p>\n<p> “You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear kind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account. You are forbidden to write—to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor, is necessary to calm our apprehensions. For a long time I have thought that each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt. I have prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so long a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being able to perform it myself! I figure to myself that the task of attending on your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor cousin. Yet that is over now: Clerval writes that indeed you are getting better. I eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own handwriting. </p>\n<p> “Get well—and return to us. You will find a happy, cheerful home and friends who love you dearly. Your father’s health is vigorous, and he asks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; and not a care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance. How pleased you would be to remark the improvement of our Ernest! He is now sixteen and full of activity and spirit. He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter into foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his elder brother returns to us. My uncle is not pleased with the idea of a military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had your powers of application. He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his time is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the lake. I fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected. </p>\n<p> “Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken place since you left us. The blue lake and snow-clad mountains—they never change; and I think our placid home and our contented hearts are regulated by the same immutable laws. My trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing none but happy, kind faces around me. Since you left us, but one change has taken place in our little household. Do you remember on what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family? Probably you do not; I will relate her history, therefore in a few words. Madame Moritz, her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the third. This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but through a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and after the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill. My aunt observed this, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house. The republican institutions of our country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it. Hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are more refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in France and England. Justine, thus received in our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being. </p>\n<p> “Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one glance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica—she looked so frank-hearted and happy. My aunt conceived a great attachment for her, by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that which she had at first intended. This benefit was fully repaid; Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world: I do not mean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress. Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate, yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt. She thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her. </p>\n<p> “When my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own grief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness with the most anxious affection. Poor Justine was very ill; but other trials were reserved for her. </p>\n<p> “One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless. The conscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her partiality. She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor confirmed the idea which she had conceived. Accordingly, a few months after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her repentant mother. Poor girl! She wept when she quitted our house; she was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable for vivacity. Nor was her residence at her mother’s house of a nature to restore her gaiety. The poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance. She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness, but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister. Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is now at peace for ever. She died on the first approach of cold weather, at the beginning of this last winter. Justine has just returned to us; and I assure you I love her tenderly. She is very clever and gentle, and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her expression continually remind me of my dear aunt. </p>\n<p> “I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling William. I wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair. When he smiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with health. He has already had one or two little <i>wives,</i> but Louisa Biron is his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age. </p>\n<p> “Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip concerning the good people of Geneva. The pretty Miss Mansfield has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage with a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq. Her ugly sister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn. Your favourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes since the departure of Clerval from Geneva. But he has already recovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a lively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier. She is a widow, and much older than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with everybody. </p>\n<p> “I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety returns upon me as I conclude. Write, dearest Victor,—one line—one word will be a blessing to us. Ten thousand thanks to Henry for his kindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are sincerely grateful. Adieu! my cousin; take care of yourself; and, I entreat you, write! </p> <p class=\"right\"> “Elizabeth Lavenza. </p> <p class=\"noindent\"> “Geneva, March 18th, 17—.”<br> </p>\n<p> “Dear, dear Elizabeth!” I exclaimed, when I had read her letter: “I will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel.” I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but my convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly. In another fortnight I was able to leave my chamber. </p>\n<p> One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the several professors of the university. In doing this, I underwent a kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained. Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy. When I was otherwise quite restored to health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms. Henry saw this, and had removed all my apparatus from my view. He had also changed my apartment; for he perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory. But these cares of Clerval were made of no avail when I visited the professors. M. Waldman inflicted torture when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I had made in the sciences. He soon perceived that I disliked the subject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out. What could I do? He meant to please, and he tormented me. I felt as if he had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death. I writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt. Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn. I thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak. I saw plainly that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from me; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in him that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which I feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply. </p>\n<p> M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even more pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman. “D—n the fellow!” cried he; “why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has outstript us all. Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true. A youngster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly as in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if he is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.—Ay, ay,” continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering, “M. Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man. Young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I was myself when young; but that wears out in a very short time.” </p>\n<p> M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me. </p>\n<p> Clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and his literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me. He came to the university with the design of making himself complete master of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for the plan of life he had marked out for himself. Resolved to pursue no inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording scope for his spirit of enterprise. The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit languages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on the same studies. Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists. I did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for I did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary amusement. I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well repaid my labours. Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy elevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of any other country. When you read their writings, life appears to consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,—in the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart. How different from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome! </p>\n<p> Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was fixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several accidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable, and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring. I felt this delay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my beloved friends. My return had only been delayed so long, from an unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become acquainted with any of its inhabitants. The winter, however, was spent cheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness. </p>\n<p> The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily which was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a pedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a personal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited. I acceded with pleasure to this proposition: I was fond of exercise, and Clerval had always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature that I had taken among the scenes of my native country. </p>\n<p> We passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits had long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the salubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and the conversation of my friend. Study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children. Excellent friend! how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own. A selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and affection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature who, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care. When happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful sensations. A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy. The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring bloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud. I was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed upon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an invincible burden. </p>\n<p> Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled his soul. The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly astonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in imitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful fancy and passion. At other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew me out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity. </p>\n<p> We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were dancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy. My own spirits were high, and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity. </p> </a></div>",
      "modern": "<p>Chapter 6</p>\n<p>Clerval then handed me a letter from my dear Elizabeth:</p>\n<p>“My dearest Cousin,</p>\n<p>You have been unwell, very unwell, and even the constant letters from kind Henry are not enough to ease my worries about you. You are forbidden to write— to hold a pen; yet I need just one word from you, dear Victor, to calm our fears. For a long time, I’ve been hoping each post would bring this line, and I’ve persuaded my uncle not to travel to Ingolstadt. I’ve kept him from facing the inconveniences and possible dangers of such a long journey, but how often have I wished I could make the trip myself! I imagine that the task of caring for you while you are sick has fallen to some indifferent old nurse, who could never understand your wishes or care for you with the love and attention of your poor cousin. But that is behind us now: Clerval writes that you are indeed getting better. I eagerly hope you will confirm this news soon in your own handwriting.</p>\n<p>Get well—and return to us. You will find a happy, cheerful home and friends who love you dearly. Your father is in good health and only wishes to see you, to be assured that you are well; and no worry will ever shadow his kind face. How pleased you would be to see the progress our Ernest has made! He is now sixteen, full of energy and spirit. He wants to be a true Swiss and enter foreign service, but we cannot part with him until his older brother returns to us. My uncle is not pleased with the idea of a military career in a distant land, but Ernest never had your dedication to study. He sees education as a burdensome chain; he spends his time outdoors, climbing hills or rowing on the lake. I fear he will become idle unless we give in and allow him to pursue the career he desires.</p>\n<p>Little has changed, aside from the growth of our dear children, since you left us. The blue lake and the snow-covered mountains—they remain the same; I believe our peaceful home and content hearts are governed by the same unchanging laws. My simple activities fill my time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for my efforts by the happy, kind faces around me. Since you left us, only one change has occurred in our little household. Do you remember how Justine Moritz came to live with us? You may not recall; let me share her story briefly. Madame Moritz, her mother, was a widow with four children, Justine being the third. This girl was always her father’s favorite, but strangely, her mother could not stand her, and after M. Moritz's death, treated her very poorly. My aunt noticed this and, when Justine was twelve, persuaded her mother to let her live with us. The republican institutions of our country have fostered simpler and happier customs than those found in the great monarchies surrounding us. Consequently, there is less distinction among the various classes of people; the lower classes are neither as poor nor as despised, and their manners are more refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not mean the same as a servant in France or England. Justine, therefore, learned the duties of a servant in our family—a role that, in our fortunate country, does not imply ignorance or a loss of human dignity.</p>\n<p>Justine, you may remember, was a great favorite of yours; I recall you once said that if you were in a bad mood, one look from Justine could lift it, just as Ariosto describes the beauty of Angelica—she looked so sincere and happy. My aunt grew very attached to her, which led her to provide an education beyond what she had initially planned. This kindness was fully returned; Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world. I don’t mean she made grand declarations; I never heard her speak such words, but you could see in her eyes that she almost adored her protector. Though her nature was cheerful and often thoughtless, she paid close attention to every gesture of my aunt. She regarded her as a model of excellence and tried to imitate her speech and mannerisms, so that even now, she often reminds me of her.</p>\n<p>When my dearest aunt passed away, everyone was too caught up in their own sorrow to notice poor Justine, who had cared for her during her illness with the utmost affection. Poor Justine fell ill herself, but more challenges awaited her.</p>\n<p>One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, left childless except for her neglected daughter, became troubled in her conscience. She began to believe that the deaths of her favorites were a punishment from heaven for her favoritism. She was a Roman Catholic, and I believe her confessor confirmed her fears. So, a few months after you left for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her repentant mother. Poor girl! She cried when she left our home; she had changed so much since my aunt's death; her grief had softened her demeanor and given her a gentle sweetness that had previously been marked by vivacity. Unfortunately, her time at her mother’s house did not restore her joy. The poor woman oscillated in her repentance. Sometimes she begged Justine to forgive her for being unkind, but more often she accused her of causing the deaths of her brothers and sister. Constant worrying eventually led Madame Moritz into a decline; it initially made her more irritable, but she has now found eternal peace. She died at the first hint of cold weather, at the beginning of this past winter. Justine has just returned to us, and I assure you I love her dearly. She is clever and gentle, and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her demeanor and expression constantly remind me of my dear aunt.</p>\n<p>I must also say a few words to you, my dear cousin, about little William. I wish you could see him; he is quite tall for his age, with sweet, laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curly hair. When he smiles, two little dimples appear on his rosy cheeks, full of health. He has already had one or two little loves, but Louisa Biron is his favorite, a pretty little girl of five years.</p>\n<p>Now, dear Victor, I’m sure you’d like to hear a bit of gossip about the good people of Geneva. The lovely Miss Mansfield has already received congratulations on her upcoming marriage to a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq. Her less attractive sister, Manon, married the wealthy banker M. Duvillard last autumn. Your favorite schoolmate, Louis Manoir, has faced several misfortunes since Clerval left Geneva. However, he has regained his spirits and is reportedly about to marry a lively, pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier. She is a widow and much older than Manoir, but she is very well-liked and admired by everyone.</p>\n<p>I’ve written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my worries return as I finish. Write, dearest Victor—just one line—one word will be a blessing to us. A thousand thanks to Henry for his kindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are sincerely grateful. Farewell, my cousin; take care of yourself; and please, write!</p>\n<p>“Elizabeth Lavenza.</p>\n<p>“Geneva, March 18th, 17—.”</p>\n<p>“Dear, dear Elizabeth!” I exclaimed after reading her letter. “I will write immediately and ease their worries.”</p>\n<p>I wrote, and this effort exhausted me greatly; but my recovery had begun and was progressing steadily. In another two weeks, I was able to leave my room. One of my first duties upon recovery was to introduce Clerval to the various professors at the university. In doing this, I endured a kind of rough treatment that was poorly suited to the wounds my mind had suffered. Ever since that fateful night, which marked the end of my labors and the beginning of my misfortunes, I had developed a strong aversion to even the name of natural philosophy. When I was otherwise completely healed, seeing a chemical instrument would reignite the agony of my nervous symptoms. Henry noticed this and had removed all my equipment from sight. He had also changed my room, as he saw I had developed a dislike for the space that had once been my laboratory. But Clerval’s efforts were of no use when I met with the professors. M. Waldman inflicted pain when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the remarkable progress I had made in my studies. He soon realized that I disliked the subject; but not comprehending the true cause, he attributed my feelings to modesty and shifted the topic from my improvement to the science itself, eager to draw me out. What could I do? He intended to be kind, and instead tormented me. I felt as if he had carefully placed, one by one, before me those instruments that would later be used to bring about my slow and painful demise. I squirmed under his words, yet dared not show the pain I felt. Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick to perceive the sensations of others, changed the subject, claiming ignorance, and the conversation took a more general turn. I thanked my friend sincerely, but I remained silent. I could see he was surprised, but he never pressed me to share my secret; and although I loved him with a mix of affection and reverence that knew no bounds, I could never bring myself to confide in him about that event which was so often on my mind but which I feared would only be more deeply imprinted by discussing it with another. M. Krempe was not so accommodating; in my state at that time, of almost unbearable sensitivity, his harsh, straightforward praises caused me even more pain than M. Waldman’s benevolent approval.</p>\n<p>“Damn the guy!” he exclaimed. “Why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has surpassed us all. Go ahead, stare if you wish; but it’s true. A kid who, just a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly as he does in the gospel, has now placed himself at the head of the university; and if he isn’t brought down soon, we’ll all be left embarrassed. Yes, yes,” he continued, noticing the anguish on my face, “M. Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man. Young men should be humble, you know, M. Clerval: I was myself when I was younger; but that wears off quickly.” M. Krempe then began to boast about himself, which fortunately shifted the conversation away from a topic that troubled me so much.</p>\n<p>Clerval had never shared my enthusiasm for natural science; his literary pursuits were entirely different from those that had consumed my attention. He came to the university determined to master the oriental languages, which he saw as a pathway to the ambitious life he had planned for himself. Resolute in avoiding an unremarkable career, he turned his gaze toward the East, seeking opportunities for his adventurous spirit. The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit languages captured his interest, and I was easily persuaded to join him in these studies. I had always found idleness uncomfortable, and now that I sought to escape reflection and despised my former studies, I felt great relief in being a fellow student with my friend, finding not only instruction but also comfort in the works of the orientalists. Unlike him, I didn’t attempt a critical understanding of their dialects, for I had no intention of using them beyond momentary amusement. I read simply to grasp their meaning, and they richly rewarded my efforts. Their melancholy was soothing, and their joy uplifting in ways I had never experienced while studying the authors of any other country. When you read their writings, life seems to consist of warm sunlight and a garden of roses—of the smiles and frowns of a beautiful enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart. How different from the manly and heroic poetry of Greece and Rome!</p>\n<p>Summer passed in these pursuits, and I had planned to return to Geneva in late autumn; however, several delays kept me there until winter and snow arrived, making the roads impassable, and my journey was postponed until the following spring. I felt this delay deeply, as I longed to see my hometown and my beloved friends. My return had been delayed solely because I didn’t want to leave Clerval in an unfamiliar place before he had gotten to know any of its inhabitants. Nevertheless, the winter was spent happily; and even though spring was unusually late, when it arrived, its beauty made up for its tardiness. By early May, I eagerly awaited the letter that would set my departure date when Henry suggested we take a walking tour around Ingolstadt, so I could say a personal goodbye to the land I had called home for so long. I gladly accepted this proposal; I loved to exercise, and Clerval had always been my favorite companion on such rambles through the landscapes of my homeland.</p>\n<p>We spent two weeks wandering; my health and spirits had long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the refreshing air I breathed, the natural experiences of our journey, and the engaging conversation of my friend. Studying had previously isolated me from the company of others and made me unsociable, but Clerval brought out the better feelings of my heart; he taught me to appreciate the beauty of nature and the joyful faces of children. Excellent friend! How sincerely you loved me, and how earnestly you tried to elevate my spirit until it matched your own. A self-centered pursuit had cramped and narrowed my outlook, but your kindness and affection warmed and opened my senses; I became the happy creature I once was, loved and beloved by all, without sorrow or care. When I was joyful, the inanimate world around me filled me with delight. A clear sky and green fields brought me ecstasy. This season was truly divine; the spring flowers bloomed in the hedges, while summer’s blossoms were already budding. I was undisturbed by the thoughts that had weighed heavily on me throughout the previous year, despite my efforts to shake them off. Henry rejoiced in my happiness and empathized with my feelings: he worked to entertain me while expressing the emotions that filled his own heart. His intellectual resources were truly remarkable; his conversation was full of imagination, and often, imitating the Persian and Arabic writers, he spun tales of wonderful fancy and passion. At other times, he recited my favorite poems or drew me into debates that he supported with great ingenuity.</p>\n<p>We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were dancing, and everyone we encountered seemed cheerful and happy. My spirits were high, and I bounded along, filled with unrestrained joy and excitement.</p>",

      "original": "<div class=\"chapter\" id=\"pgepubid00013\"> <h2><a id=\"chap07\">Chapter 7</a></h2><a id=\"chap07\"> <p> On my return, I found the following letter from my father:— </p> <p class=\"letter\"> “My dear Victor, </p>\n<p> “You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few lines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you. But that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it. What would be your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness? And how, Victor, can I relate our misfortune? Absence cannot have rendered you callous to our joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent son? I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is impossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings. </p>\n<p> “William is dead!—that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay! Victor, he is murdered! </p>\n<p> “I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the circumstances of the transaction. </p>\n<p> “Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to walk in Plainpalais. The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged our walk farther than usual. It was already dusk before we thought of returning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone on before, were not to be found. We accordingly rested on a seat until they should return. Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen his brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that William had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and afterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return. </p>\n<p> “This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him until night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned to the house. He was not there. We returned again, with torches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night; Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. About five in the morning I discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and active in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the print of the murder’s finger was on his neck. </p>\n<p> “He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest to see the corpse. At first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted, and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, ‘O God! I have murdered my darling child!’ </p>\n<p> “She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she again lived, it was only to weep and sigh. She told me, that that same evening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that she possessed of your mother. This picture is gone, and was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed. We have no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved William! </p>\n<p> “Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth. She weeps continually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death; her words pierce my heart. We are all unhappy; but will not that be an additional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter? Your dear mother! Alas, Victor! I now say, Thank God she did not live to witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling! </p>\n<p> “Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin, but with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of festering, the wounds of our minds. Enter the house of mourning, my friend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not with hatred for your enemies. </p> <p class=\"right\"> “Your affectionate and afflicted father,<br> “Alphonse Frankenstein. </p> <p class=\"noindent\"> “Geneva, May 12th, 17—.”<br> </p>\n<p> Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was surprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy I at first expressed on receiving news from my friends. I threw the letter on the table, and covered my face with my hands. </p>\n<p> “My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me weep with bitterness, “are you always to be unhappy? My dear friend, what has happened?” </p>\n<p> I motioned him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the room in the extremest agitation. Tears also gushed from the eyes of Clerval, as he read the account of my misfortune. </p>\n<p> “I can offer you no consolation, my friend,” said he; “your disaster is irreparable. What do you intend to do?” </p>\n<p> “To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.” </p>\n<p> During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation; he could only express his heartfelt sympathy. “Poor William!” said he, “dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother! Who that had seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his untimely loss! To die so miserably; to feel the murderer’s grasp! How much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence! Poor little fellow! one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but he is at rest. The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever. A sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain. He can no longer be a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable survivors.” </p>\n<p> Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words impressed themselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards in solitude. But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a cabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend. </p>\n<p> My journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when I drew near my native town, I slackened my progress. I could hardly sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. I passed through scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years. How altered every thing might be during that time! One sudden and desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. Fear overcame me; I dared no advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble, although I was unable to define them. </p>\n<p> I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. I contemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the snowy mountains, “the palaces of nature,” were not changed. By degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey towards Geneva. </p>\n<p> The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I approached my native town. I discovered more distinctly the black sides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc. I wept like a child. “Dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your wanderer? Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and placid. Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?” </p>\n<p> I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on these preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative happiness, and I think of them with pleasure. My country, my beloved country! who but a native can tell the delight I took in again beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely lake! </p>\n<p> Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night also closed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still more gloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I foresaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human beings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single circumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure. </p>\n<p> It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates of the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at Secheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city. The sky was serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot where my poor William had been murdered. As I could not pass through the town, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais. During this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont Blanc in the most beautiful figures. The storm appeared to approach rapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its progress. It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain coming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased. </p>\n<p> I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head. It was echoed from Salêve, the Juras, and the Alps of Savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself from the preceding flash. The storm, as is often the case in Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The most violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of Copêt. Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the Môle, a peaked mountain to the east of the lake. </p>\n<p> While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with a hasty step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my hands, and exclaimed aloud, “William, dear angel! this is thy funeral, this thy dirge!” As I said these words, I perceived in the gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy dæmon, to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be (I shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did that idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support. The figure passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could have destroyed the fair child. <i>He</i> was the murderer! I could not doubt it. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the south. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared. </p>\n<p> I remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain still continued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I revolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget: the whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of the works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure. Two years had now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and was this his first crime? Alas! I had turned loose into the world a depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not murdered my brother? </p>\n<p> No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the night, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and despair. I considered the being whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to me. </p>\n<p> Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town. The gates were open, and I hastened to my father’s house. My first thought was to discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be made. But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain. I remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable. I well knew that if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity. Besides, the strange nature of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited as to persuade my relatives to commence it. And then of what use would be pursuit? Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of Mont Salêve? These reflections determined me, and I resolved to remain silent. </p>\n<p> It was about five in the morning when I entered my father’s house. I told the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library to attend their usual hour of rising. </p>\n<p> Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my departure for Ingolstadt. Beloved and venerable parent! He still remained to me. I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the mantel-piece. It was an historical subject, painted at my father’s desire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling by the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale; but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the sentiment of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my tears flowed when I looked upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernest entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me: “Welcome, my dearest Victor,” said he. “Ah! I wish you had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and delighted. You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can alleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.—Poor William! he was our darling and our pride!” </p>\n<p> Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother’s eyes; a sense of mortal agony crept over my frame. Before, I had only imagined the wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and a not less terrible, disaster. I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more minutely concerning my father, and here I named my cousin. </p>\n<p> “She most of all,” said Ernest, “requires consolation; she accused herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her very wretched. But since the murderer has been discovered—” </p>\n<p> “The murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be? who could attempt to pursue him? It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw. I saw him too; he was free last night!” </p>\n<p> “I do not know what you mean,” replied my brother, in accents of wonder, “but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery. No one would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed, who would credit that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family, could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?” </p>\n<p> “Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it is wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?” </p>\n<p> “No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have almost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear, leaves no hope for doubt. But she will be tried today, and you will then hear all.” </p>\n<p> He then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William had been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her bed for several days. During this interval, one of the servants, happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer. The servant instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition, Justine was apprehended. On being charged with the fact, the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of manner. </p>\n<p> This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied earnestly, “You are all mistaken; I know the murderer. Justine, poor, good Justine, is innocent.” </p>\n<p> At that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness deeply impressed on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and, after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced some other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed, “Good God, papa! Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of poor William.” </p>\n<p> “We do also, unfortunately,” replied my father, “for indeed I had rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly.” </p>\n<p> “My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.” </p>\n<p> “If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is to be tried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.” </p>\n<p> This speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind that Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder. I had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong enough to convict her. My tale was not one to announce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as madness by the vulgar. Did any one indeed exist, except I, the creator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance which I had let loose upon the world? </p>\n<p> We were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had altered her since I last beheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of her childish years. There was the same candour, the same vivacity, but it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect. She welcomed me with the greatest affection. “Your arrival, my dear cousin,” said she, “fills me with hope. You perhaps will find some means to justify my poor guiltless Justine. Alas! who is safe, if she be convicted of crime? I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do upon my own. Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate. If she is condemned, I never shall know joy more. But she will not, I am sure she will not; and then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little William.” </p>\n<p> “She is innocent, my Elizabeth,” said I, “and that shall be proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her acquittal.” </p>\n<p> “How kind and generous you are! every one else believes in her guilt, and that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible: and to see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me hopeless and despairing.” She wept. </p>\n<p> “Dearest niece,” said my father, “dry your tears. If she is, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the activity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of partiality.” </p> </a></div>",
      "modern": "<p>CHAPTER 7</p>\n<p>On my return, I found the following letter from my father:</p>\n<p>“My dear Victor,</p>\n<p>You have probably been waiting anxiously for a letter to confirm the date of your return to us. At first, I was tempted to write only a few lines, simply mentioning when I expected you. But that would be a cruel kindness, and I cannot do it. What would be your shock, my son, when you were hoping for a joyful welcome, to instead see tears and despair? And how can I share our misfortune with you? Time apart cannot have made you indifferent to our joys and sorrows; how can I inflict pain on my son who has been away for so long? I wish to prepare you for the tragic news, but I know that is impossible; even now, your eyes skim the page searching for the words that will convey this awful tidings.</p>\n<p>“William is dead!—that sweet child, whose smiles warmed my heart, who was so gentle yet so full of life! Victor, he has been murdered!</p>\n<p>“I will not attempt to comfort you; I will simply recount the events as they unfolded.</p>\n<p>“Last Thursday (May 7th), I, your niece, and your two brothers went for a walk in Plainpalais. The evening was warm and calm, and we wandered farther than usual. It was dusk before we thought of returning, and then we realized that William and Ernest, who had gone ahead, were nowhere to be found. We decided to rest on a bench until they returned. Soon, Ernest came back and asked if we had seen his brother. He said they had been playing, that William had run off to hide, and that he had searched for him in vain before waiting a long time; but William did not return.</p>\n<p>“This news worried us, and we continued to search for him until night fell. Elizabeth suggested that he might have gone back home. He was not there. We returned again with torches, for I could not rest, thinking that my sweet boy was lost and exposed to the dampness of the night; Elizabeth was also in deep distress. Around five in the morning, I found my lovely boy, whom I had seen thriving and healthy just the night before, lying on the grass, pale and still; the marks of the murderer’s hand were on his neck.</p>\n<p>“He was brought home, and the anguish evident on my face revealed the truth to Elizabeth. She was desperate to see the body. I initially tried to stop her, but she insisted, and upon entering the room where it lay, she hurriedly examined the victim’s neck and, clasping her hands, cried out, ‘O God! I have murdered my darling child!’</p>\n<p>“She fainted, and it took much effort to revive her. When she regained consciousness, it was only to weep and sigh. She told me that the evening before, William had begged her to let him wear a very valuable miniature of your mother that she possessed. That picture is gone, and was surely the temptation that drove the murderer to commit the crime. We currently have no leads on him, despite our relentless efforts to find him; but those efforts will not bring back my beloved William!</p>\n<p>“Come, my dearest Victor; only you can comfort Elizabeth. She weeps constantly and unjustly blames herself for his death; her words pierce my heart. We are all miserable; but won’t that be an additional reason for you, my son, to return and be our source of comfort? Your dear mother! Alas, Victor! I now say, thank God she did not live to witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!</p>\n<p>“Come, Victor; not with vengeful thoughts against the killer, but with feelings of peace and kindness that will heal, rather than fester, the wounds in our hearts. Enter our house of mourning, my friend, with love and affection for those who cherish you, not with hatred for your enemies.</p>\n<p>“Your affectionate and grieving father,</p>\n<p>“Alphonse Frankenstein.</p>\n<p>“Geneva, May 12th, 17—.”</p>\n<p>Clerval, who had been watching my face as I read this letter, was surprised to see the despair that followed the joy I initially felt from receiving news from my friends. I threw the letter on the table and covered my face with my hands.</p>\n<p>“My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed Henry, noticing my bitter tears, “are you always to be unhappy? My dear friend, what has happened?”</p>\n<p>I gestured for him to pick up the letter while I paced the room in extreme agitation. Tears also flowed from Clerval’s eyes as he read the account of my misfortune.</p>\n<p>“I can offer you no consolation, my friend,” he said. “Your disaster is irreparable. What do you plan to do?”</p>\n<p>“To go immediately to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to arrange for the horses.”</p>\n<p>As we walked, Clerval tried to say a few comforting words; he could only express his heartfelt sympathy.</p>\n<p>“Poor William!” he said. “Dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother! Who could have seen him bright and joyful in his young beauty without weeping over his untimely loss? To die so wretchedly; to feel the murderer’s grip! How much worse for one who could destroy such radiant innocence! Poor little fellow! One consolation remains; his friends mourn and weep, but he is at peace. The pain is over, his suffering has ended forever. A grave covers his gentle form, and he knows no more pain. He can no longer be a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable survivors.”</p>\n<p>Clerval spoke as we hurried through the streets; his words impressed themselves on my mind, and I remembered them later in solitude. But as soon as the horses arrived, I quickly climbed into a cabriolet and bade my friend farewell.</p>\n<p>My journey was filled with melancholy. At first, I wanted to rush forward, eager to console and sympathize with my beloved, grieving friends; but as I approached my hometown, I slowed my pace. I could hardly bear the flood of emotions that overwhelmed me. I passed through familiar scenes of my youth, which I had not seen in nearly six years. How much could have changed in that time! A sudden and devastating loss had taken place, but a thousand small changes might have gradually brought about other alterations that, although quieter, could be just as impactful. Fear overtook me; I dared not go further, dreading a thousand nameless horrors that made me tremble, although I could not define them.</p>\n<p>I remained for two days in Lausanne, lost in this painful state of mind. I gazed at the lake: the waters were calm; everything around was peaceful, and the snowy mountains, “the palaces of nature,” had not changed. Gradually, the serene and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey toward Geneva.</p>\n<p>The road ran alongside the lake, which grew narrower as I neared my hometown. I could more clearly see the dark slopes of Jura and the bright peak of Mont Blanc. I wept like a child. “Dear mountains! My beautiful lake! How do you welcome your wanderer? Your peaks are clear; the sky and lake are blue and calm. Is this a sign of peace, or just mocking my unhappiness?”</p>\n<p>I fear, my friend, that I might become tedious by dwelling on these preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative happiness, and I think of them fondly. My country, my beloved country! Who but a native can understand the joy I felt in seeing your streams, your mountains, and most of all, your lovely lake once more! Yet, as I drew nearer to home, grief and fear began to overcome me again. Night fell around me, and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt even gloomier. The scene appeared vast and dim, filled with evil, and I sensed that I was destined to become the most wretched of humans. Alas! I was right in my prophecy, and only failed to foresee the extent of the anguish I was destined to endure.</p>\n<p>It was completely dark when I arrived near Geneva; the town gates were already shut, and I had to spend the night at Secheron, a village half a league from the city. The sky was clear; and as I couldn’t find rest, I resolved to visit the spot where my poor William had been murdered. Since I couldn’t pass through the town, I had to cross the lake in a boat to reach Plainpalais.</p>\n<p>During this brief voyage, I saw lightning dancing on the summit of Mont Blanc in beautiful patterns. The storm seemed to approach quickly, and upon landing, I climbed a low hill to watch its progress. It came closer; the sky darkened, and I soon felt the rain beginning slowly in large drops, but its intensity quickly increased. I left my seat and walked on, even as the darkness and storm grew stronger by the minute, and the thunder crashed terrifyingly overhead. It echoed from Salêve, the Juras, and the Alps of Savoy; bright flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the lake and making it appear as if it were on fire; then for a moment, everything was engulfed in pitch darkness until my eyes adjusted after the previous flash.</p>\n<p>The storm, as is often the case in Switzerland, seemed to break out in various parts of the sky at once. The most violent storm hung directly north of the town, over the section of the lake between the promontory of Belrive and the village of Copêt. Another storm lit up Jura with faint flashes; another darkened and occasionally revealed the Môle, a peaked mountain to the east of the lake. While I watched this tempest, beautiful yet terrifying, I continued walking at a hurried pace. This noble battle in the sky lifted my spirits; I clasped my hands and exclaimed aloud, “William, dear angel! This is your funeral, this your dirge!”</p>\n<p>As I spoke these words, I saw a figure emerge from behind a cluster of trees nearby; I stood frozen, staring intently. I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning illuminated the figure, revealing its shape clearly to me; its towering stature and the hideous deformity of its form, more monstrous than anything human, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy demon, to whom I had given life. What was he doing there? Could he be (I shuddered at the thought) the murderer of my brother? No sooner had that idea crossed my mind than I was convinced of its truth; my teeth chattered, and I had to lean against a tree for support. The figure passed me quickly, and I lost it in the darkness. Nothing in human form could have killed my beautiful child. He was the murderer! I could not doubt it. The mere thought of it was irrefutable proof of the fact.</p>\n<p>I considered pursuing the monster, but it would have been futile, as another flash revealed him hanging among the rocks of the steep ascent of Mont Salêve, a hill that borders Plainpalais to the south. He quickly reached the summit and vanished. I remained motionless. The thunder ceased, but the rain continued, and the scene was cloaked in impenetrable darkness. I reflected on the events I had tried to forget: the entire sequence of my journey to creation; the appearance of the creature I had brought to life at my bedside; its departure. Nearly two years had passed since that night when it first received life; and was this its first crime? Alas! I had unleashed a depraved wretch upon the world, one whose delight lay in carnage and misery; had he not murdered my brother? No one can fathom the anguish I suffered for the rest of the night, which I spent cold and wet in the open air. Yet I hardly felt the discomfort of the weather; my mind was consumed by scenes of evil and despair. I thought of the being I had cast among humanity, endowed with the will and power to wreak horror, just like the deed he had now committed, almost as if he were my own vampire, my own spirit unleashed from the grave, forced to destroy everything dear to me.</p>\n<p>Day broke, and I made my way toward the town. The gates opened, and I rushed to my father’s house. My first thought was to reveal what I knew about the murderer and to demand an immediate pursuit. But I hesitated when I considered the story I had to tell. A being I had created, endowed with life, had met me at midnight among the cliffs of an inaccessible mountain. I also recalled the nervous fever I had suffered just as I recorded the date of my creation, which would make my tale sound delirious and utterly improbable. I knew that if anyone else had shared such a story with me, I would have dismissed it as the ravings of madness. Moreover, the creature’s strange nature would evade any pursuit, even if I could persuade my relatives to initiate it. And then what good would a pursuit be? Who could catch a creature capable of climbing the steep cliffs of Mont Salêve? These thoughts led me to decide to remain silent.</p>\n<p>It was around five in the morning when I entered my father’s house. I told the servants not to disturb the family and went into the library to wait for their usual rising hour. Six years had passed, like a dream except for one indelible trace, and I stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my departure for Ingolstadt. Beloved and venerable parent! He still remained with me. I gazed at the portrait of my mother, which hung over the mantelpiece. It was a historical painting, done at my father’s request, depicting Caroline Beaufort in despair, kneeling by the coffin of her deceased father. She wore a rustic outfit, her cheek pale; yet there was an air of dignity and beauty that barely allowed for pity. Below this painting was a miniature of William, and my tears flowed as I looked at it.</p>\n<p>While I was lost in thought, Ernest entered; he had heard me arrive and rushed to welcome me.</p>\n<p>“Welcome, my dearest Victor,” he said. “Ah! I wish you had come three months ago; then you would have found us all joyful and full of life. You return now to share in a misery that nothing can ease; yet I hope your presence will revive our father, who seems to be succumbing to his grief, and that your persuasions will help poor Elizabeth cease her tormenting self-blame. Poor William! He was our darling and our pride!”</p>\n<p>Tears flowed freely from my brother’s eyes; a sense of deep agony washed over me. Before, I had only imagined the sorrow of my desolate home; the reality struck me as a new and equally terrible disaster. I tried to calm Ernest and asked more about our father, and here I mentioned my cousin.</p>\n<p>“She most of all,” said Ernest, “needs comfort; she blames herself for my brother’s death, which has made her very unhappy. But since the murderer has been found—”</p>\n<p>“The murderer found! Good God! How can that be? Who could attempt to pursue him? It’s impossible; one might as well try to chase the wind or stop a mountain stream with a straw. I saw him too; he was free last night!”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” replied my brother, astonished, “but for us, the discovery we’ve made has only added to our misery. No one would believe it at first; and even now, Elizabeth won’t be convinced, despite all the evidence. Indeed, who would believe that Justine Moritz, who was so kind and fond of our family, could suddenly become capable of such a horrific crime?”</p>\n<p>“Justine Moritz! Poor girl, is she the accused? But this is wrong; everyone knows that; surely no one believes it, Ernest?”</p>\n<p>“No one did at first; but several circumstances have emerged that have nearly forced us to accept it; and her own behavior has been so confused that it adds to the weight of evidence, which, I fear, leaves no room for doubt. But she will be tried today, and you will hear everything then.”</p>\n<p>He then explained that on the morning when poor William’s murder was discovered, Justine had fallen ill and had been confined to bed for several days. During this time, one of the servants, while inspecting the clothes she had worn on the night of the murder, found the picture of my mother in her pocket, which had been judged to be the murderer’s temptation. The servant immediately showed it to another, who, without saying anything to the family, went to a magistrate; and based on their testimony, Justine was arrested. When confronted with the accusation, the poor girl largely confirmed the suspicion by her extreme confusion. This was a strange story, but it did not shake my belief; I replied earnestly, “You are all mistaken; I know the murderer. Justine, poor, good Justine, is innocent.”</p>\n<p>At that moment, my father entered. I saw deep sorrow etched on his face, but he tried to greet me cheerfully; after we exchanged our sad greetings, he would have shifted the topic away from our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed, “Good God, papa! Victor says he knows who murdered poor William.”</p>\n<p>“We do too, unfortunately,” replied my father. “I would rather have remained ignorant than to discover such depravity and ingratitude in one I valued so highly.”</p>\n<p>“My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.”</p>\n<p>“If she is, God forbid she should suffer as if guilty. She is to be tried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.”</p>\n<p>This statement calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind that Justine, and indeed every human being, was innocent of this murder. I feared no circumstantial evidence could be strong enough to convict her. My tale was not one to share publicly; its astounding horror would be seen as madness by the masses. Did anyone truly exist, besides me, the creator, who would believe, unless their senses convinced them, in the existence of the living monument of presumption and reckless ignorance which I had unleashed upon the world?</p>\n<p>We were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had changed her since I last saw her; it had given her a beauty that surpassed her childhood charm. There was the same openness, the same liveliness, but now paired with an expression rich in sensitivity and intellect. She welcomed me with the greatest affection.</p>\n<p>“Your arrival, my dear cousin,” she said, “fills me with hope. Perhaps you will find some way to justify my poor innocent Justine. Alas! Who is safe if she is convicted of a crime? I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do my own. Our misfortune is doubly hard; we have lost that lovely boy, but this dear girl, whom I truly love, is to be taken away by an even worse fate. If she is condemned, I will never know joy again. But she will not, I am sure she will not; and then I will be happy again, even after the sorrow of losing my little William.”</p>\n<p>“She is innocent, my Elizabeth,” I said, “and that will be proven; fear not, but let your</p>",

      "original": "<div class=\"chapter\" id=\"pgepubid00014\"> <h2><a id=\"chap08\">Chapter 8</a></h2><a id=\"chap08\"> <p> We passed a few sad hours until eleven o’clock, when the trial was to commence. My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of this wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture. It was to be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would cause the death of two of my fellow beings: one a smiling babe full of innocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror. Justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised to render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an ignominious grave, and I the cause! A thousand times rather would I have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I was absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have exculpated her who suffered through me. </p>\n<p> The appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning, and her countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her feelings, exquisitely beautiful. Yet she appeared confident in innocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by thousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. She was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage. When she entered the court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were seated. A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness. </p>\n<p> The trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the charge, several witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined against her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof of her innocence as I had. She had been out the whole of the night on which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterwards found. The woman asked her what she did there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused and unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about eight o’clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly if anything had been heard concerning him. When shown the body, she fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days. The picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket; and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court. </p>\n<p> Justine was called on for her defence. As the trial had proceeded, her countenance had altered. Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly expressed. Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was desired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible although variable voice. </p>\n<p> “God knows,” she said, “how entirely I am innocent. But I do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocence on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced against me, and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears doubtful or suspicious.” </p>\n<p> She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the house of an aunt at Chêne, a village situated at about a league from Geneva. On her return, at about nine o’clock, she met a man who asked her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost. She was alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him, when the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known. Most of the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke. It was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour to find my brother. If she had gone near the spot where his body lay, it was without her knowledge. That she had been bewildered when questioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed a sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain. Concerning the picture she could give no account. </p>\n<p> “I know,” continued the unhappy victim, “how heavily and fatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of explaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been placed in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe that I have no enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly. Did the murderer place it there? I know of no opportunity afforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen the jewel, to part with it again so soon? </p>\n<p> “I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for hope. I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my character, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my innocence.” </p>\n<p> Several witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and they spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come forward. Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused, when, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address the court. </p>\n<p> “I am,” said she, “the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have lived with his parents ever since and even long before his birth. It may therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, but when I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I know of her character. I am well acquainted with the accused. I have lived in the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly two years. During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and benevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in her last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited the admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my uncle’s house, where she was beloved by all the family. She was warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a most affectionate mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that, notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely on her perfect innocence. She had no temptation for such an action; as to the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it, I should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value her.” </p>\n<p> A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth’s simple and powerful appeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in favour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with renewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude. She herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer. My own agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial. I believed in her innocence; I knew it. Could the dæmon who had (I did not for a minute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy? I could not sustain the horror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice and the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim, I rushed out of the court in agony. The tortures of the accused did not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold. </p>\n<p> I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I went to the court; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the fatal question, but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my visit. The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine was condemned. </p>\n<p> I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before experienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the heart-sickening despair that I then endured. The person to whom I addressed myself added that Justine had already confessed her guilt. “That evidence,” he observed, “was hardly required in so glaring a case, but I am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our judges like to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so decisive.” </p>\n<p> This was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean? Had my eyes deceived me? And was I really as mad as the whole world would believe me to be if I disclosed the object of my suspicions? I hastened to return home, and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result. </p>\n<p> “My cousin,” replied I, “it is decided as you may have expected; all judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty should escape. But she has confessed.” </p>\n<p> This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon Justine’s innocence. “Alas!” said she. “How shall I ever again believe in human goodness? Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as my sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray? Her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she has committed a murder.” </p>\n<p> Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my cousin. My father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own judgment and feelings to decide. “Yes,” said Elizabeth, “I will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany me; I cannot go alone.” The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet I could not refuse. </p>\n<p> We entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld Justine sitting on some straw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on her knees. She rose on seeing us enter, and when we were left alone with her, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly. My cousin wept also. </p>\n<p> “Oh, Justine!” said she. “Why did you rob me of my last consolation? I relied on your innocence, and although I was then very wretched, I was not so miserable as I am now.” </p>\n<p> “And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked? Do you also join with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer?” Her voice was suffocated with sobs. </p>\n<p> “Rise, my poor girl,” said Elizabeth; “why do you kneel, if you are innocent? I am not one of your enemies, I believed you guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you had yourself declared your guilt. That report, you say, is false; and be assured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a moment, but your own confession.” </p>\n<p> “I did confess, but I confessed a lie. I confessed, that I might obtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than all my other sins. The God of heaven forgive me! Ever since I was condemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced, until I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said I was. He threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if I continued obdurate. Dear lady, I had none to support me; all looked on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition. What could I do? In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly miserable.” </p>\n<p> She paused, weeping, and then continued, “I thought with horror, my sweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed aunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable of a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated. Dear William! dearest blessed child! I soon shall see you again in heaven, where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I am to suffer ignominy and death.” </p>\n<p> “Oh, Justine! Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you. Why did you confess? But do not mourn, dear girl. Do not fear. I will proclaim, I will prove your innocence. I will melt the stony hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers. You shall not die! You, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold! No! No! I never could survive so horrible a misfortune.” </p>\n<p> Justine shook her head mournfully. “I do not fear to die,” she said; “that pang is past. God raises my weakness and gives me courage to endure the worst. I leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the fate awaiting me. Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience to the will of heaven!” </p>\n<p> During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison room, where I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me. Despair! Who dared talk of that? The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass the awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as I did, such deep and bitter agony. I gnashed my teeth and ground them together, uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul. Justine started. When she saw who it was, she approached me and said, “Dear sir, you are very kind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty?” </p>\n<p> I could not answer. “No, Justine,” said Elizabeth; “he is more convinced of your innocence than I was, for even when he heard that you had confessed, he did not credit it.” </p>\n<p> “I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerest gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness. How sweet is the affection of others to such a wretch as I am! It removes more than half my misfortune, and I feel as if I could die in peace now that my innocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.” </p>\n<p> Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. She indeed gained the resignation she desired. But I, the true murderer, felt the never-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or consolation. Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair moon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness. Anguish and despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within me which nothing could extinguish. We stayed several hours with Justine, and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear herself away. “I wish,” cried she, “that I were to die with you; I cannot live in this world of misery.” </p>\n<p> Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty repressed her bitter tears. She embraced Elizabeth and said in a voice of half-suppressed emotion, “Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth, my beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and preserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer! Live, and be happy, and make others so.” </p>\n<p> And on the morrow Justine died. Elizabeth’s heart-rending eloquence failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the criminality of the saintly sufferer. My passionate and indignant appeals were lost upon them. And when I received their cold answers and heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed avowal died away on my lips. Thus I might proclaim myself a madman, but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim. She perished on the scaffold as a murderess! </p>\n<p> From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and voiceless grief of my Elizabeth. This also was my doing! And my father’s woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was the work of my thrice-accursed hands! Ye weep, unhappy ones, but these are not your last tears! Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard! Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear countenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life in serving you—he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments! </p>\n<p> Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair, I beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and Justine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts. </p> </a></div>",
      "modern": "<p>Chapter 8</p>\n<p>We spent a few sorrowful hours until eleven o’clock, when the trial was set to begin. My father and the rest of the family had to attend as witnesses, so I went with them to the courtroom. Throughout this miserable farce of justice, I endured living torture. It was to be determined whether my reckless curiosity and actions had led to the deaths of two people: one a joyful babe full of innocence, the other brutally murdered in a way that would forever be remembered for its horror. Justine was also a remarkable girl with qualities that promised her a happy life; now all of that was about to be erased in a shameful grave, and I was the reason! I would have rather confessed to the crime that Justine was accused of, but I had been absent when it occurred, and such a confession would have only been seen as the ramblings of a madman and would not have saved her from suffering because of me.</p>\n<p>Justine appeared calm. She was dressed in mourning, and her face, always lovely, was made even more beautiful by the weight of her feelings. She seemed confident in her innocence and did not tremble, even though she was being stared at and condemned by thousands. The kindness her beauty might have inspired in the onlookers was overshadowed by their belief in the terrible crime she was accused of. She was composed, yet her calmness was clearly forced; her previous confusion had been cited as evidence of her guilt, so she steeled herself to show courage. When she entered the courtroom, she looked around and quickly spotted where we were seated. A tear seemed to cloud her eye when she saw us, but she quickly regained her composure, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to prove her complete innocence.</p>\n<p>The trial began, and after the prosecutor stated the charges against her, several witnesses were called. Numerous odd facts were presented against her, which could have shaken anyone who didn’t have the proof of her innocence that I had. She had been out all night on the evening of the murder and, toward morning, had been seen by a market woman not far from where the body of the murdered child was later found. The woman had asked her what she was doing there, but Justine had looked strange and only managed a confused and unintelligible answer. She returned home around eight o’clock, and when someone asked where she had spent the night, she replied that she had been looking for the child and earnestly inquired if anything had been heard about him. When shown the body, she fell into violent hysterics and remained in bed for several days. A picture was then presented, which the servant had found in her pocket; when Elizabeth, in a trembling voice, confirmed that it was the same picture she had placed around the child’s neck just an hour before he went missing, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the courtroom.</p>\n<p>Justine was called to defend herself. As the trial progressed, her expression changed. Surprise, horror, and misery were clearly visible on her face. At times, she struggled with tears, but when asked to plead, she gathered her strength and spoke in a voice that was steady despite its wavering tone. “God knows,” she said, “how completely innocent I am. But I don’t expect my claims of innocence to clear me; I rely on a straightforward and simple explanation of the facts against me, and I hope my character will lead my judges to interpret any suspicious circumstances favorably.” She then explained that, with Elizabeth’s permission, she had spent the night of the murder at her aunt’s house in Chêne, a village about a league from Geneva. On her way back around nine o’clock, she encountered a man who asked if she had seen the lost child. Alarmed, she spent several hours searching for him when the gates of Geneva were closed, forcing her to stay in a barn belonging to a cottage for several hours, not wanting to disturb the residents, with whom she was well acquainted. She spent most of the night there, keeping watch; towards morning, she believed she dozed off for a few minutes, but some footsteps startled her awake. It was dawn, and she left her hiding place to continue searching for my brother. If she had wandered near the spot where his body lay, it was without her knowledge. Her bewilderment when questioned by the market woman was understandable, as she had spent a sleepless night, and the fate of poor William was still uncertain. Regarding the picture, she could offer no explanation. “I know,” she continued, “how heavily this one circumstance weighs against me, but I cannot explain it; and after expressing my complete ignorance, I am left only to guess how it might have ended up in my pocket. But here too, I am at a loss. I believe I have no enemies on earth, and surely none would be so wicked as to harm me for no reason. Did the murderer place it there? I have no idea how he could have done so; and if I had, why would he have stolen the jewel only to return it so quickly? I commit my case to the justice of my judges, yet I see no hope. I ask for a few witnesses to be examined regarding my character, and if their testimony does not outweigh the accusations against me, I must be condemned, even though I would stake my salvation on my innocence.”</p>\n<p>Several witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and they spoke highly of her; but fear and hatred of the crime she was believed to have committed made them hesitant to come forward. Elizabeth saw that even this last hope, her excellent character and irreproachable conduct, might fail the accused. Though visibly upset, she requested permission to address the court. “I am,” she said, “the cousin of the unfortunate child who was murdered, or rather his sister, since I have lived with his parents ever since and even long before his birth. It may seem inappropriate for me to speak on this occasion, but when I see a fellow being about to perish because of the cowardice of her so-called friends, I wish to be allowed to speak about her character. I know the accused well. I have lived in the same house with her, at one time for five years and at another for nearly two. Throughout that time, I found her to be the most kind and benevolent of people. She cared for Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, during her last illness with the greatest affection and diligence, and later attended her own mother during a long illness, earning the admiration of everyone who knew her. After that, she lived in my uncle’s house, where she was beloved by the entire family. She was deeply attached to the child who is now dead and treated him like a devoted mother. As for me, I do not hesitate to say that despite all the evidence against her, I believe and trust in her complete innocence. She had no motive for such an act; as for the trinket that is the primary evidence, if she had truly wanted it, I would have gladly given it to her, for I hold her in such high regard.”</p>\n<p>A murmur of approval followed Elizabeth’s heartfelt and powerful statement, but it was driven by her generous interference, not in support of poor Justine, who faced renewed public outrage, accused of the worst ingratitude. Justine herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not respond. My own agitation and anguish were overwhelming throughout the trial. I believed in her innocence; I knew it. Could the monster who had, without a doubt, murdered my brother also, in his wickedness, have betrayed the innocent to death and disgrace? I could not bear the horror of my situation, and when I saw that the public sentiment and the judges' expressions had already condemned my poor victim, I rushed out of the courtroom in agony. The torments of the accused could not compare to mine; she was sustained by her innocence, while the fangs of remorse tore at my heart and would not let go.</p>\n<p>I spent a night filled with unrelenting misery. In the morning, I returned to the court; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the dreadful question, but I was recognized, and the officer guessed the reason for my visit. The ballots had been cast; they were all black, and Justine was condemned. I cannot express what I felt in that moment. I had previously experienced horror, and I tried to articulate it, but words cannot convey the heart-sickening despair I felt then. The person I spoke to added that Justine had already confessed her guilt. “That evidence,” he noted, “was hardly necessary in such a clear case, but I am glad of it; indeed, none of our judges prefer to condemn someone based solely on circumstantial evidence, no matter how convincing.”</p>\n<p>This was strange and unexpected news; what could it mean? Had my eyes deceived me? Was I truly as mad as everyone would think if I revealed the source of my suspicions? I hurried home, and Elizabeth eagerly asked for the outcome. “My cousin,” I replied, “it has been decided as you might have expected; all judges would rather that ten innocent people suffer than that one guilty person escape. But she has confessed.” This was a devastating blow to poor Elizabeth, who had firmly believed in Justine’s innocence. “Alas!” she said. “How will I ever believe in human goodness again? Justine, whom I loved and regarded as my sister, how could she wear those smiles of innocence only to betray us? Her gentle eyes seemed incapable of malice or deceit, and yet she has committed a murder.”</p>\n<p>Soon after, we learned that the poor victim wished to see my cousin. My father didn’t want her to go but left the decision to her judgment and feelings. “Yes,” Elizabeth said, “I will go, even though she is guilty; and you, Victor, will accompany me; I cannot go alone.” The thought of this visit was torture for me, yet I could not refuse. We entered the dark prison chamber and found Justine sitting on some straw at the far end; her hands were shackled, and her head rested on her knees. She stood when she saw us enter, and once we were alone with her, she fell at Elizabeth’s feet, crying bitterly. My cousin also wept. “Oh, Justine!” she said. “Why did you take away my last comfort? I believed in your innocence, and though I was already very unhappy, I am now even more miserable.”</p>\n<p>“Do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked? Do you join my enemies in crushing me, condemning me as a murderer?” Her voice was choked with sobs. “Get up, my poor girl,” Elizabeth said; “why do you kneel if you are innocent? I am not one of your enemies; I believed you were innocent, despite all the evidence, until I heard you had declared your guilt. If that report is false, you must assure me, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my faith in you for even a moment but your own confession.”</p>\n<p>“I did confess, but I confessed to a lie. I confessed so that I might gain forgiveness; but now that falsehood weighs heavier on my heart than all my other sins. May God in heaven forgive me! Ever since I was condemned, my confessor has pestered me; he threatened and intimidated me until I almost began to believe I was the monster he said I was. He threatened me with excommunication and hellfire in my last moments if I remained stubborn. Dear lady, I had no one to support me; everyone viewed me as a wretch doomed to disgrace and destruction. What could I do? In a moment of weakness, I agreed to a lie; and now I am truly miserable.” She paused, weeping, then continued, “I thought with horror, my sweet lady, that you would believe your Justine, whom your blessed aunt honored so highly and whom you loved, was capable of a crime that only the devil himself could commit. Dear William! Dearest blessed child! I will soon see you again in heaven, where we will all be happy; that comforts me as I go to face disgrace and death.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, Justine! Forgive me for doubting you even for a moment. Why did you confess? But do not grieve, dear girl. Do not be afraid. I will proclaim your innocence; I will prove it. I will soften the hard hearts of your enemies with my tears and prayers. You shall not die! You, my playmate, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold! No! No! I could never survive such a horrible misfortune.” Justine shook her head sadly. “I do not fear death,” she said; “that pain has passed. God strengthens my weakness and gives me the courage to endure the worst. I leave a sad and bitter world; if you remember me as someone unjustly condemned, I am resigned to my fate. Learn from me, dear lady, to accept patiently the will of heaven!”</p>\n<p>During this conversation, I had retreated to a corner of the prison room where I could hide the dreadful anguish that consumed me. Despair! Who dared speak of that? The poor victim, who was to cross the terrible boundary between life and death the next day, did not feel the deep and bitter agony that I did. I gritted my teeth and ground them together, letting out a groan that came from the depths of my soul. Justine flinched. When she saw it was me, she approached and said, “Dear sir, you are very kind to visit me; I hope you do not believe I am guilty?” I couldn’t answer. “No, Justine,” said Elizabeth; “he is more convinced of your innocence than I was, for even when he heard that you had confessed, he did not believe it.”</p>\n<p>“I truly thank him. In these last moments, I feel the deepest gratitude toward those who think of me with kindness. How sweet is the affection of others to someone like me! It eases more than half my misfortune, and I feel I could die in peace now that my innocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.” Thus, the poor sufferer tried to comfort both herself and others. She did indeed gain the resignation she sought. But I, the true murderer, felt the never-ending torment alive in my chest, offering no hope or consolation. Elizabeth also wept and felt unhappy, but her sorrow came from innocence, which, like a cloud passing over the bright moon, may obscure it for a time but cannot tarnish its glow. Agony and despair had penetrated the core of my heart; I carried a hell within me that nothing could extinguish.</p>\n<p>We stayed with Justine for several hours, and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could pull herself away. “I wish,” she cried, “that I could die with you; I cannot live in this world of misery.” Justine tried to appear cheerful, though she struggled to hold back her own bitter tears. She embraced Elizabeth and said, her voice half-choked with emotion, “Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth, my beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its kindness, bless and protect you; may this be the last misfortune you ever endure! Live, and be happy, and help others be so.” And the next day, Justine died. Elizabeth’s heart-wrenching pleas failed to sway the judges from their firm belief in the guilt of the innocent sufferer. My passionate and indignant appeals fell on deaf ears. When I received their cold responses and heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my intended confession died on my lips. Thus, I could proclaim myself a madman, but I could not overturn the sentence against my wretched victim. She perished on the scaffold as a murderer!</p>\n<p>In the midst of my own heartache, I turned to the deep, voiceless grief of my Elizabeth. This, too, was my doing! The sorrow of my father and the desolation of our once joyful home—all were the result of my cursed actions! You weep, unhappy ones, but these are not your last tears! You will again raise the funeral wail, and the sound of your lamentations will echo again and again! Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, beloved friend; he who would give every drop of blood for you, who knows no joy except as it reflects in your dear faces, who would fill the air with blessings and devote his life to serving you—he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond his hopes, if thus unyielding fate is satisfied, and if destruction pauses before the peace of the grave replaces your sorrow! Thus spoke my tormented soul, as, consumed by remorse, horror, and despair, I watched those I loved waste their tears on the graves of William and Justine, the first tragic victims of my unholy arts.</p>",

      "original": "<div class=\"chapter\" id=\"pgepubid00015\"> <h2><a id=\"chap09\">Chapter 9</a></h2><a id=\"chap09\"> <p> Nothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope and fear. Justine died, she rested, and I was alive. The blood flowed freely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my heart which nothing could remove. Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered like an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond description horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded myself) was yet behind. Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue. I had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment when I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow beings. Now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience which allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and from thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures such as no language can describe. </p>\n<p> This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps never entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained. I shunned the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me; solitude was my only consolation—deep, dark, deathlike solitude. </p>\n<p> My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me. “Do you think, Victor,” said he, “that I do not suffer also? No one could love a child more than I loved your brother”—tears came into his eyes as he spoke—“but is it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief? It is also a duty owed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment, or even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for society.” </p>\n<p> This advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I should have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if remorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my other sensations. Now I could only answer my father with a look of despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view. </p>\n<p> About this time we retired to our house at Belrive. This change was particularly agreeable to me. The shutting of the gates regularly at ten o’clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that hour had rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome to me. I was now free. Often, after the rest of the family had retired for the night, I took the boat and passed many hours upon the water. Sometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and sometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections. I was often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and heavenly—if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and interrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore—often, I say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters might close over me and my calamities for ever. But I was restrained, when I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine. I thought also of my father and surviving brother; should I by my base desertion leave them exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose among them? </p>\n<p> At these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my mind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness. But that could not be. Remorse extinguished every hope. I had been the author of unalterable evils, and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I had created should perpetrate some new wickedness. I had an obscure feeling that all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime, which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past. There was always scope for fear so long as anything I loved remained behind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. When I thought of him I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished to extinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When I reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation. I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the Andes, could I, when there, have precipitated him to their base. I wished to see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his head and avenge the deaths of William and Justine. </p>\n<p> Our house was the house of mourning. My father’s health was deeply shaken by the horror of the recent events. Elizabeth was sad and desponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted and destroyed. She was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our future prospects. The first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from the earth had visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest smiles. </p>\n<p> “When I reflect, my dear cousin,” said she, “on the miserable death of Justine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they before appeared to me. Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient days or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other’s blood. Yet I am certainly unjust. Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; and if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human creatures. For the sake of a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend, a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if it had been her own! I could not consent to the death of any human being, but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society of men. But she was innocent. I know, I feel she was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me. Alas! Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can assure themselves of certain happiness? I feel as if I were walking on the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. William and Justine were assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free, and perhaps respected. But even if I were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places with such a wretch.” </p>\n<p> I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony. I, not in deed, but in effect, was the true murderer. Elizabeth read my anguish in my countenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, “My dearest friend, you must calm yourself. These events have affected me, God knows how deeply; but I am not so wretched as you are. There is an expression of despair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance that makes me tremble. Dear Victor, banish these dark passions. Remember the friends around you, who centre all their hopes in you. Have we lost the power of rendering you happy? Ah! While we love, while we are true to each other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your native country, we may reap every tranquil blessing—what can disturb our peace?” </p>\n<p> And could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my heart? Even as she spoke I drew near to her, as if in terror, lest at that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her. </p>\n<p> Thus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of heaven, could redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love were ineffectual. I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial influence could penetrate. The wounded deer dragging its fainting limbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had pierced it, and to die, was but a type of me. </p>\n<p> Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me, but sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily exercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable sensations. It was during an access of this kind that I suddenly left my home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought in the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and my ephemeral, because human, sorrows. My wanderings were directed towards the valley of Chamounix. I had visited it frequently during my boyhood. Six years had passed since then: <i>I</i> was a wreck, but nought had changed in those savage and enduring scenes. </p>\n<p> I performed the first part of my journey on horseback. I afterwards hired a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive injury on these rugged roads. The weather was fine; it was about the middle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of Justine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe. The weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in the ravine of Arve. The immense mountains and precipices that overhung me on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as Omnipotence—and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here displayed in their most terrific guise. Still, as I ascended higher, the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character. Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the impetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty. But it was augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another earth, the habitations of another race of beings. </p>\n<p> I passed the bridge of Pélissier, where the ravine, which the river forms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that overhangs it. Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix. This valley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and picturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed. The high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields. Immense glaciers approached the road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and marked the smoke of its passage. Mont Blanc, the supreme and magnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding <i>aiguilles</i>, and its tremendous <i>dôme</i> overlooked the valley. </p>\n<p> A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this journey. Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and recognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the lighthearted gaiety of boyhood. The very winds whispered in soothing accents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no more. Then again the kindly influence ceased to act—I found myself fettered again to grief and indulging in all the misery of reflection. Then I spurred on my animal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all, myself—or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on the grass, weighed down by horror and despair. </p>\n<p> At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix. Exhaustion succeeded to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I had endured. For a short space of time I remained at the window watching the pallid lightnings that played above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing of the Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath. The same lulling sounds acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when I placed my head upon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came and blessed the giver of oblivion. </p> </a></div>",
      "modern": "<p>Chapter 9</p>\n<p>Nothing is more painful to the human mind than the dead calmness that follows a whirlwind of emotions, stripping the soul of both hope and fear. Justine died; she was at peace, and I was alive. My blood flowed freely, but a crushing weight of despair and guilt pressed on my heart that nothing could lift. Sleep eluded me; I drifted like a restless spirit, having committed unspeakable acts of horror, and I convinced myself that much more was yet to come. Still, my heart overflowed with kindness and a desire for good. I had started my life with noble intentions, eager for the day when I could help others. Now all that was ruined; instead of the peace of mind that would allow me to reflect on the past with satisfaction and draw hope for the future, I was consumed by remorse and guilt, dragging me into a hell of suffering that words cannot capture. This torment took a toll on my health, which had perhaps never fully recovered from the initial shock. I avoided human contact; every sound of joy or contentment felt like a stab to my heart; solitude was my only comfort—deep, dark, deathlike solitude.</p>\n<p>My father noticed the change in my demeanor and habits with sorrow. He tried to inspire me with courage and to help me lift the dark cloud that hung over me, using arguments based on his own serene conscience and guilt-free life. “Do you think, Victor,” he said, “that I don’t suffer too? No one could love a child more than I loved your brother”—tears filled his eyes—“but isn’t it our duty to those who remain to avoid adding to their pain with excessive grief? It’s also a duty to yourself, as overwhelming sorrow blocks improvement and enjoyment, leaving no man fit for society.” While his advice was wise, it didn’t apply to me. I would have been the first to hide my grief and comfort my friends, if not for the bitterness of remorse and terror that tainted my feelings. Now, I could only respond to my father with a look of despair, trying to hide from his gaze.</p>\n<p>Around this time, we returned to our house in Belrive. This change was particularly welcome to me. The regular closing of the gates at ten o'clock and the prohibition on staying by the lake after that hour had made our home in Geneva feel unbearable. Now I was free. Often, after the rest of the family had gone to bed, I took a boat and spent hours on the water. Sometimes, with my sails unfurled, I let the wind carry me; other times, I would row to the middle of the lake, let the boat drift, and sink into my miserable thoughts. I was tempted, when everything around me was peaceful and I was the only restless being in such a beautiful setting—aside from the occasional bat or the croaking frogs, which only sounded when I neared the shore—to plunge into the silent lake, letting the water cover me and my troubles forever. But I held back, thinking of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I loved dearly, and whose life was intertwined with mine. I also thought of my father and surviving brother; how could I abandon them to the malice of the monster I had unleashed? In those moments, I wept bitterly, wishing for peace of mind, just so I could offer them comfort and happiness. But that was impossible. Remorse snuffed out every hope. I had caused irreversible harm, and I lived in constant fear that the creature I had created would commit new atrocities. I had a nagging feeling that it wasn’t over and that he would still carry out some heinous act that would overshadow the past. There was always room for fear as long as anything I loved remained.</p>\n<p>My hatred for this fiend was beyond words. When I thought of him, I ground my teeth, my eyes burned with anger, and I desperately wished to end the life I had so carelessly given. Reflecting on his crimes and malice, my hatred and desire for revenge knew no limits. I would have journeyed to the highest peak of the Andes just to throw him from it. I longed to see him again, to pour out my complete disdain upon him and avenge the deaths of William and Justine. Our home was shrouded in mourning. My father’s health was severely affected by the horror of recent events. Elizabeth was sad and hopeless; she found no joy in her usual activities; everything felt like a sacrilege against the dead; she believed eternal sorrow and tears were the only appropriate tribute to innocence so tragically destroyed. She was no longer the happy girl who once wandered with me by the lake, dreaming excitedly about our future. The first of life’s sorrows, meant to detach us from the earth, had visited her, and its dulling influence snuffed out her brightest smiles.</p>\n<p>“When I think, my dear cousin,” she said, “about the miserable death of Justine Moritz, I can no longer see the world and its works as I once did. Before, I thought of tales of vice and injustice I read or heard as stories of ancient times or imagined evils; they felt distant and more reasonable than real. But now, suffering has come home, and people seem like monsters eager for each other's blood. Yet I know I am being unfair. Everyone believed that poor girl was guilty; if she had committed the crime for which she suffered, she would have been the most depraved of humans. To kill the son of her benefactor and friend for a few jewels, a child she had cared for since birth and loved as if he were her own! I could never agree to the death of any human being, yet I would have thought such a person unfit to live among us. But she was innocent. I know, I feel she was innocent; you share my belief, and that reassures me. Alas! Victor, when lies can appear so truthful, who can assure themselves of happiness? I feel like I’m walking on the edge of a cliff, with countless people trying to push me into the abyss. William and Justine were murdered, and the killer is free; he walks the earth, perhaps respected. Even if I were condemned to hang for the same crimes, I wouldn’t want to switch places with such a wretch.”</p>\n<p>I listened to her words with intense agony. I was, not in action, but in effect, the true murderer. Elizabeth saw my torment in my face and gently took my hand, saying, “My dearest friend, you must calm yourself. These events have affected me deeply; God knows how deeply. But I am not as miserable as you are. There is a look of despair, sometimes revenge, in your eyes that frightens me. Dear Victor, banish these dark feelings. Remember the friends around you, who place all their hopes in you. Have we lost the power to make you happy? As long as we love each other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your homeland, we can enjoy every tranquil blessing—what could disturb our peace?”</p>\n<p>And could her words, coming from the one I cherished above all else, not chase away the demon lurking in my heart? As she spoke, I drew near to her, terrified that at that very moment, the destroyer was close by to take her from me. Thus, not even the warmth of friendship, nor the beauty of the earth or sky, could free my soul from suffering; even the words of love were powerless. I was surrounded by a cloud that no comforting influence could penetrate. The wounded deer dragging itself to a secluded thicket to gaze upon the arrow that struck it and die was a perfect image of me. Sometimes I could manage the heavy despair that engulfed me, but at other times, the storm of my emotions drove me to seek relief through physical activity and change of scenery from my unbearable feelings. It was during one of these episodes that I suddenly left home, making my way toward the nearby Alpine valleys, hoping that the grandeur and eternity of those landscapes would help me escape from myself and my fleeting human sorrows.</p>\n<p>I directed my travels towards the valley of Chamounix, a place I had often visited in my youth. Six years had passed since then: I was a wreck, yet nothing had changed in those rugged, timeless landscapes. I traveled the first part of my journey on horseback, then hired a mule for its sure-footedness on the rough roads. The weather was fine; it was mid-August, nearly two months after Justine’s death, the wretched time from which I counted all my misery. The burden on my spirit felt lighter as I ventured deeper into the Arve ravine. The immense mountains and cliffs loomed around me, the sound of the river crashing against the rocks and the roar of the waterfalls spoke of a power as great as Omnipotence—and I ceased to fear or bow to anything less than that which had created and controlled the elements, now displayed in their most terrifying form.</p>\n<p>As I climbed higher, the valley became even more magnificent and awe-inspiring. Ruined castles clung to the cliffs of pine-covered mountains, the roaring Arve, and cottages peeking out from among the trees created a scene of unique beauty. But this beauty was enhanced and made sublime by the mighty Alps, their white, gleaming peaks and domes towering above all, as if from another earth, the home of another race of beings. I crossed the Pélissier bridge, where the ravine created by the river opened before me, and began to ascend the mountain that loomed above it. Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix. This valley, while more wonderful and grand than the one I had just traversed, lacked the picturesque beauty of Servox. Towering, snowy mountains formed its borders, but I saw no more crumbling castles or fertile fields. Massive glaciers crept toward the road; I heard the rumbling thunder of avalanches crashing down and saw the smoke of their descent. Mont Blanc, the majestic and supreme Mont Blanc, rose above the surrounding peaks, its tremendous dome overlooking the valley.</p>\n<p>A long-lost thrill of joy often washed over me during this journey. A bend in the road or a new sight would remind me of happier days, intertwined with the carefree joy of childhood. The very winds whispered soothing words, and Mother Nature seemed to urge me not to weep anymore. Yet again, that kind influence faded—I found myself shackled to grief, helplessly indulging in all the misery of reflection. In desperation, I urged my mount on, trying to forget the world, my fears, and, more than anything, myself—or, in a more frantic manner, I dismounted and threw myself onto the grass, weighed down by horror and despair.</p>\n<p>Finally, I reached the village of Chamounix. Exhaustion overcame me after the extreme fatigue of both body and mind that I had endured. For a brief moment, I sat at the window, watching the pale lightning flicker above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing Arve below. The same soothing sounds acted as a lullaby to my overly sensitive feelings; as I laid my head on the pillow, sleep gently overtook me; I felt it coming and silently thanked the giver of oblivion.</p>",

      "original": "<div class=\"chapter\" id=\"pgepubid00016\"> <h2><a id=\"chap10\">Chapter 10</a></h2><a id=\"chap10\"> <p> I spent the following day roaming through the valley. I stood beside the sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to barricade the valley. The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious presence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by the brawling waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the avalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws, was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in their hands. These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving. They elevated me from all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my grief, they subdued and tranquillised it. In some degree, also, they diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the last month. I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were, waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I had contemplated during the day. They congregated round me; the unstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods, and ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds—they all gathered round me and bade me be at peace. </p>\n<p> Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke? All of soul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every thought. The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the summits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those mighty friends. Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them in their cloudy retreats. What were rain and storm to me? My mule was brought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of Montanvert. I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it. It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy. The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the effect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing cares of life. I determined to go without a guide, for I was well acquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the solitary grandeur of the scene. </p>\n<p> The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short windings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the mountain. It is a scene terrifically desolate. In a thousand spots the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie broken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent, leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon other trees. The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines of snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw destruction upon the head of the speaker. The pines are not tall or luxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene. I looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I received from the objects around me. Alas! Why does man boast of sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders them more necessary beings. If our impulses were confined to hunger, thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may convey to us. </p> <p class=\"poem\"> We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We rise; one wand’ring thought pollutes the day.<br> We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;<br> It is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The path of its departure still is free.<br> Man’s yesterday may ne’er be like his morrow;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nought may endure but mutability! </p>\n<p> It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent. For some time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist covered both that and the surrounding mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated the cloud, and I descended upon the glacier. The surface is very uneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and interspersed by rifts that sink deep. The field of ice is almost a league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it. The opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. From the side where I now stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league; and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty. I remained in a recess of the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene. The sea, or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains, whose aerial summits hung over its recesses. Their icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds. My heart, which was before sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed, “Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow beds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion, away from the joys of life.” </p>\n<p> As I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance, advancing towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded over the crevices in the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his stature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of man. I was troubled; a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me, but I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains. I perceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred!) that it was the wretch whom I had created. I trembled with rage and horror, resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in mortal combat. He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish, combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes. But I scarcely observed this; rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance, and I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious detestation and contempt. </p>\n<p> “Devil,” I exclaimed, “do you dare approach me? And do not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head? Begone, vile insect! Or rather, stay, that I may trample you to dust! And, oh! That I could, with the extinction of your miserable existence, restore those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered!” </p>\n<p> “I expected this reception,” said the dæmon. “All men hate the wretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all living things! Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature, to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of one of us. You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life? Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind. If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and you at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.” </p>\n<p> “Abhorred monster! Fiend that thou art! The tortures of hell are too mild a vengeance for thy crimes. Wretched devil! You reproach me with your creation, come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I so negligently bestowed.” </p>\n<p> My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another. </p>\n<p> He easily eluded me and said, </p>\n<p> “Be calm! I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred on my devoted head. Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to increase my misery? Life, although it may only be an accumulation of anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it. Remember, thou hast made me more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my joints more supple. But I will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee. I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part, the which thou owest me. Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every other and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy clemency and affection, is most due. Remember that I am thy creature; I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.” </p>\n<p> “Begone! I will not hear you. There can be no community between you and me; we are enemies. Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight, in which one must fall.” </p>\n<p> “How can I move thee? Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and compassion? Believe me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul glowed with love and humanity; but am I not alone, miserably alone? You, my creator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures, who owe me nothing? They spurn and hate me. The desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge. I have wandered here many days; the caves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the only one which man does not grudge. These bleak skies I hail, for they are kinder to me than your fellow beings. If the multitude of mankind knew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for my destruction. Shall I not then hate them who abhor me? I will keep no terms with my enemies. I am miserable, and they shall share my wretchedness. Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that not only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage. Let your compassion be moved, and do not disdain me. Listen to my tale; when you have heard that, abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve. But hear me. The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they are, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned. Listen to me, Frankenstein. You accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature. Oh, praise the eternal justice of man! Yet I ask you not to spare me; listen to me, and then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands.” </p>\n<p> “Why do you call to my remembrance,” I rejoined, “circumstances of which I shudder to reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and author? Cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw light! Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you! You have made me wretched beyond expression. You have left me no power to consider whether I am just to you or not. Begone! Relieve me from the sight of your detested form.” </p>\n<p> “Thus I relieve thee, my creator,” he said, and placed his hated hands before my eyes, which I flung from me with violence; “thus I take from thee a sight which you abhor. Still thou canst listen to me and grant me thy compassion. By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this from you. Hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of this place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon the mountain. The sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another world, you will have heard my story and can decide. On you it rests, whether I quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless life, or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of your own speedy ruin.” </p>\n<p> As he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed. My heart was full, and I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I weighed the various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to his tale. I was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my resolution. I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my brother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion. For the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards his creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I complained of his wickedness. These motives urged me to comply with his demand. We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite rock. The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we entered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy heart and depressed spirits. But I consented to listen, and seating myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began his tale. </p> </a></div>",
      "modern": "<p>CHAPTER 10</p>\n<p>The next day, I wandered through the valley. I stood by the source of the Arveiron, which begins in a glacier slowly moving down from the hilltops to block the valley. The steep sides of the vast mountains loomed before me; the icy wall of the glacier towered overhead. Scattered around were a few shattered pines, and the profound silence of this magnificent chamber of nature was broken only by the roaring waves or the crash of some large fragment, the thunder of an avalanche, or the cracking sound of accumulated ice. This ice was constantly being rent and torn apart, as if it were merely a plaything in the hands of immutable laws.</p>\n<p>These sublime and magnificent scenes brought me the greatest comfort I could receive. They lifted me above all feelings of pettiness, and though they didn’t erase my grief, they subdued and calmed it. In some way, they also distracted my mind from the thoughts I had been brooding over for the past month. I went to bed that night; my dreams seemed to be attended to by the grand shapes I had contemplated during the day. They gathered around me—the pristine snowy mountaintop, the glittering peak, the pine forests, and the rugged ravines, even the eagle soaring among the clouds—they all surrounded me and urged me to find peace.</p>\n<p>But where had they gone when I awoke the next morning? All that inspiring spirit faded with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every thought. Rain poured in torrents, and thick mists obscured the mountain peaks, so I couldn’t even see the faces of my mighty friends. Still, I was determined to penetrate their misty veil and seek them out in their cloudy retreats. What were rain and storm to me? My mule was brought to the door, and I resolved to climb to the summit of Montanvert. I remembered the effect that the sight of the tremendous and ever-moving glacier had on me when I first saw it. It had filled me with a sublime ecstasy that lifted my soul, allowing it to soar from the dark world to light and joy.</p>\n<p>The sight of the awe-inspiring and majestic in nature had always solemnized my mind and helped me forget the fleeting worries of life. I decided to go without a guide, as I knew the path well, and the presence of another would ruin the solitary grandeur of the scene. The ascent is steep, but the path is cut into continuous and short windings, which help you overcome the mountain’s sheer drop. It is a scene terrifyingly desolate. In countless spots, you can see the traces of winter avalanches where trees lie broken and scattered on the ground—some completely destroyed, others bent and leaning against jutting rocks or other trees.</p>\n<p>As you climb higher, the path is interrupted by snow-filled ravines, down which stones constantly roll from above; one of these is particularly dangerous, as even the slightest sound, like speaking in a loud voice, can create enough air pressure to bring destruction upon the speaker. The pines are not tall or lush, but they are dark and add a grim atmosphere to the scene. I looked down at the valley; vast mists were rising from the rivers flowing through it, curling in thick spirals around the opposite mountains, whose summits were shrouded in uniform clouds, while rain fell from the dark sky, further adding to the melancholy impression I felt from the surroundings.</p>\n<p>Alas! Why does man boast of feelings superior to those of animals? It only makes them more necessary beings. If our impulses were limited to hunger, thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are swayed by every breeze that blows and by any casual word or scene it may evoke. We rest—a dream can poison our sleep. We rise—one wandering thought can taint the day. We feel, conceive, or reason; we laugh or weep, embrace our sorrow, or cast away our cares. It’s all the same: whether joy or sorrow, the path of its departure remains open. Man’s yesterday can never be like his tomorrow; nothing endures but change!</p>\n<p>It was nearly noon when I reached the top of the ascent. For a while, I sat on a rock overlooking the sea of ice. A mist covered both it and the surrounding mountains. Soon, a breeze swept away the cloud, and I descended onto the glacier. The surface is very uneven, rising like the waves of a disturbed sea, dipping low, and interspersed with deep rifts. The field of ice is almost a league wide, but I spent nearly two hours crossing it. The opposite mountain is a bare, sheer rock. From where I stood, Montanvert was directly across, about a league away, and above it rose Mont Blanc in all its terrible majesty. I stayed in a rocky recess, gazing at this wonderful and awe-inspiring scene.</p>\n<p>The sea, or rather the vast river of ice, wound through the mountains that descended toward it, their lofty summits looming over its depths. Their icy and shimmering peaks shone in the sunlight above the clouds. My heart, which had been sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed, “Wandering spirits, if you indeed wander and do not rest in your narrow beds, grant me this slight happiness or take me away as your companion from the joys of life.”</p>\n<p>As I said this, I suddenly saw the figure of a man, some distance away, moving toward me with superhuman speed. He leaped over the crevices in the ice that I had carefully navigated; his stature seemed to exceed that of a man as he approached. I felt troubled; a mist came over my eyes, and I felt faint, but I quickly recovered thanks to the cold mountain breeze. As the figure drew nearer—an image both terrifying and loathsome—I realized it was the wretch I had created. I trembled with rage and horror, determined to confront him in combat.</p>\n<p>He came closer; his face showed bitter anguish mixed with disdain and malice, and its unearthly ugliness made it almost too horrible for human eyes. But I barely noticed this; rage and hatred had initially robbed me of my voice, and I regained it only to unleash a torrent of words filled with furious detestation and contempt. “Devil,” I shouted, “do you dare approach me? Do you not fear the fierce vengeance of my arm unleashed upon your miserable head? Begone, vile insect! Or better yet, stay, so I may trample you to dust! And oh! If only I could wipe out your miserable existence and restore those victims you have so diabolically murdered!”</p>\n<p>“I expected this reception,” said the creature. “All men hate the wretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am more miserable than any living being! Yet you, my creator, detest and reject me, your creature, bound to you by ties that can only be severed by the annihilation of one of us. You plan to kill me. How dare you toy with life like this? Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of humanity. If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and you at peace; but if you refuse, I will feast on death until it is satisfied with the blood of your remaining friends.”</p>\n<p>“Abominable monster! Fiend that you are! The tortures of hell are too mild a punishment for your crimes. Wretched devil! You reproach me for creating you; then come on, so I can extinguish the spark I so carelessly gave you.” My rage was boundless; I lunged at him, driven by all the emotions that can fuel one being against the existence of another. He easily evaded me and said, “Be calm! I implore you to hear me before you unleash your hatred upon my devoted head. Have I not suffered enough that you seek to increase my misery? Life, even if it is just an accumulation of anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it. Remember, you have made me more powerful than yourself; I am taller than you, my joints are more flexible. But I will not be tempted to oppose you. I am your creature and will be mild and docile to my natural lord and king if you will also fulfill your part, which you owe me.</p>\n<p>Oh, Frankenstein, do not treat me as you do others and trample upon me alone, to whom your justice, and even your clemency and affection, are most due. Remember that I am your creature; I ought to be your Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel whom you have cast away from joy for no wrongdoing. Everywhere I see happiness, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded. I was good and benevolent; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I will be virtuous again.”</p>\n<p>“Begone! I will not listen to you. There can be no relationship between you and me; we are enemies. Leave, or let’s test our strength in a fight, where one of us must fall.”</p>\n<p>“How can I move you? Will no pleas cause you to look kindly upon your creature, who implores your goodness and compassion? Believe me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul glowed with love and humanity; but am I not alone, miserably alone? You, my creator, abhor me; what hope can I have from your fellow creatures, who owe me nothing? They reject and despise me. The desolate mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge. I have wandered here for many days; the ice caves, which I fear not, are my home, and the only one that man does not begrudge me. I welcome these bleak skies because they are kinder to me than your fellow beings. If mankind knew of my existence, they would do as you do and arm themselves for my destruction. Should I not then hate those who detest me? I will make no terms with my enemies. I am miserable, and they will share my suffering. Yet it is in your power to compensate me and save them from an evil that only you can make so great that not only you and your family but thousands of others will be caught in its fury.</p>\n<p>Let your compassion be stirred, and do not scorn me. Listen to my story; when you have heard it, abandon or pity me as you judge I deserve. But hear me. The guilty, according to human laws, however bloody they may be, are allowed to speak in their own defense before they are condemned. Listen to me, Frankenstein. You accuse me of murder, yet you would, with a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature. Oh, praise the eternal justice of man! Yet I do not ask you to spare me; listen to me, and then, if you can, and if you wish, destroy the work of your hands.”</p>\n<p>“Why do you remind me,” I replied, “of circumstances that make me shudder to reflect upon, that I have been the miserable origin and author? Cursed be the day, accursed devil, when you first saw the light! Cursed (though I curse myself) be the hands that formed you! You have made me wretched beyond measure. You have left me no power to consider whether I am just to you or not. Begone! Free me from the sight of your detested form.”</p>\n<p>“Thus I relieve you, my creator,” he said, and placed his hated hands before my eyes, which I violently pushed away; “thus I take away from you the sight you abhor. Still, you can listen to me and grant me your compassion. By the virtues I once had, I demand this from you. Hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature here is not suitable for your fine sensibilities; come to the hut on the mountain. The sun is still high in the sky; before it sets behind your snowy cliffs and illuminates another world, you will have heard my story and can decide. It rests with you whether I leave the vicinity of man forever and lead a harmless life or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the cause of your own imminent ruin.”</p>\n<p>As he said this, he led the way across the ice; I followed. My heart was heavy, and I didn’t answer him, but as I walked, I considered the various arguments he had made and resolved at least to listen to his tale. I was partly driven by curiosity, and compassion solidified my decision. Until now, I had believed him to be my brother’s murderer, and I eagerly sought confirmation or denial of this belief. For the first time, I also felt what a creator's duties toward his creature were, and that I should make him happy before I complained of his wickedness. These motives compelled me to comply with his request.</p>\n<p>We crossed the ice and climbed the opposite rock. The air was cold, and the rain began to fall again; we entered the hut, the fiend appearing triumphant, while I felt heavy-hearted and depressed. But I agreed to listen, and sitting by the fire that my loathsome companion had lit, he began his tale.</p>",

      "original": "<div class=\"chapter\" id=\"pgepubid00017\"> <h2><a id=\"chap11\">Chapter 11</a></h2><a id=\"chap11\"> <p> “It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of my being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct. A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard, and smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses. By degrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I was obliged to shut my eyes. Darkness then came over me and troubled me, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening my eyes, as I now suppose, the light poured in upon me again. I walked and, I believe, descended, but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations. Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my touch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with no obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid. The light became more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as I walked, I sought a place where I could receive shade. This was the forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst. This roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground. I slaked my thirst at the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep. </p>\n<p> “It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half frightened, as it were, instinctively, finding myself so desolate. Before I had quitted your apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some clothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night. I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could distinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat down and wept. </p>\n<p> “Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of pleasure. I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees. [The moon] I gazed with a kind of wonder. It moved slowly, but it enlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries. I was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with which I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground. No distinct ideas occupied my mind; all was confused. I felt light, and hunger, and thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and on all sides various scents saluted me; the only object that I could distinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with pleasure. </p>\n<p> “Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had greatly lessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from each other. I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage. I was delighted when I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my ears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had often intercepted the light from my eyes. I began also to observe, with greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me. Sometimes I tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable. Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence again. </p>\n<p> “The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened form, showed itself, while I still remained in the forest. My sensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received every day additional ideas. My eyes became accustomed to the light and to perceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect from the herb, and by degrees, one herb from another. I found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and enticing. </p>\n<p> “One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been left by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the warmth I experienced from it. In my joy I thrust my hand into the live embers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain. How strange, I thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects! I examined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be composed of wood. I quickly collected some branches, but they were wet and would not burn. I was pained at this and sat still watching the operation of the fire. The wet wood which I had placed near the heat dried and itself became inflamed. I reflected on this, and by touching the various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself in collecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have a plentiful supply of fire. When night came on and brought sleep with it, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished. I covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches upon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sank into sleep. </p>\n<p> “It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire. I uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame. I observed this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the embers when they were nearly extinguished. When night came again I found, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for I found some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees. I tried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on the live embers. I found that the berries were spoiled by this operation, and the nuts and roots much improved. </p>\n<p> “Food, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole day searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. When I found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto inhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be more easily satisfied. In this emigration I exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew not how to reproduce it. I gave several hours to the serious consideration of this difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply it, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood towards the setting sun. I passed three days in these rambles and at length discovered the open country. A great fall of snow had taken place the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the appearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that covered the ground. </p>\n<p> “It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and shelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd. This was a new sight to me, and I examined the structure with great curiosity. Finding the door open, I entered. An old man sat in it, near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast. He turned on hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable. His appearance, different from any I had ever before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me. But I was enchanted by the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as Pandæmonium appeared to the dæmons of hell after their sufferings in the lake of fire. I greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd’s breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese, milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like. Then, overcome by fatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep. </p>\n<p> “It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which shone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my travels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant’s breakfast in a wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until at sunset I arrived at a village. How miraculous did this appear! The huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by turns. The vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw placed at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite. One of the best of these I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot within the door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted. The whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until, grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel, quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had beheld in the village. This hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, I dared not enter it. My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so low that I could with difficulty sit upright in it. No wood, however, was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain. </p>\n<p> “Here, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter, however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more from the barbarity of man. As soon as morning dawned I crept from my kennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could remain in the habitation I had found. It was situated against the back of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig sty and a clear pool of water. One part was open, and by that I had crept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived with stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on occasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and that was sufficient for me. </p>\n<p> “Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I retired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power. I had first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf of coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drink more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by my retreat. The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm. </p>\n<p> “Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until something should occur which might alter my determination. It was indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence, the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth. I ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I beheld a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel. The girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found cottagers and farmhouse servants to be. Yet she was meanly dressed, a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair hair was plaited but not adorned: she looked patient yet sad. I lost sight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail, which was now partly filled with milk. As she walked along, seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose countenance expressed a deeper despondence. Uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the cottage himself. She followed, and they disappeared. Presently I saw the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the house and sometimes in the yard. </p>\n<p> “On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the cottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been filled up with wood. In one of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate. Through this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean but very bare of furniture. In one corner, near a small fire, sat an old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude. The young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale. It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before. The silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love. He played a sweet mournful air which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt at his feet. He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection that I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced, either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the window, unable to bear these emotions. </p>\n<p> “Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a load of wood. The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of his burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on the fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage, and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese. She seemed pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she placed in water, and then upon the fire. She afterwards continued her work, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots. After he had been employed thus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the cottage together. </p>\n<p> “The old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to eat. The meal was quickly dispatched. The young woman was again occupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth. Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures. One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming with benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his figure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency. The old man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different from those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the fields. </p>\n<p> “Night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found that the cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours. In the evening the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations which I did not understand; and the old man again took up the instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning. So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play, but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the harmony of the old man’s instrument nor the songs of the birds; I since found that he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the science of words or letters. </p>\n<p> “The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time, extinguished their lights and retired, as I conjectured, to rest.” </p> </a></div>",
      "modern": "<p>Chapter 11</p>\n<p>It’s hard for me to remember the early days of my existence; everything from that time feels confused and unclear. A strange mix of sensations overwhelmed me, and I saw, felt, heard, and smelled all at once. It took me a long time to learn how to separate my senses. Gradually, I recall a stronger light pressing on my nerves, forcing me to shut my eyes. Darkness then enveloped me and caused me distress, but as soon as I opened my eyes, the light flooded back in. I walked, and I think I descended, but soon I noticed a significant change in my sensations.</p>\n<p>Before, I was surrounded by dark, solid objects that I couldn’t touch or see clearly; now I could move freely, with no obstacles that I couldn’t overcome or avoid. The light became increasingly oppressive, and the heat made me weary as I walked, so I looked for a place to find shade. This was the forest near Ingolstadt; there, I lay beside a brook to rest from my fatigue until hunger and thirst tormented me. This roused me from my near-slumber, and I ate some berries I found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground. I quenched my thirst at the brook and then lay down, succumbing to sleep.</p>\n<p>When I awoke, it was dark; I felt cold and instinctively frightened to find myself so alone. Before I left your room, feeling cold, I had covered myself with some clothes, but they were not enough to protect me from the night dew. I was a poor, helpless, miserable creature; I couldn’t distinguish anything, only feeling pain surround me, and I sat down and wept.</p>\n<p>Soon, a gentle light began to fill the sky, bringing me a sense of pleasure. I jumped up and saw a radiant figure rise among the trees. It was the moon. I gazed at it in wonder. It moved slowly but illuminated my path, so I ventured out again in search of berries. I was still cold when I found a large cloak under one of the trees, which I wrapped around myself as I sat on the ground. My thoughts were jumbled; everything felt confused. I sensed light, hunger, thirst, and darkness; countless sounds echoed in my ears, and various scents greeted me from all sides. The only clear object was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on it with pleasure.</p>\n<p>Days and nights passed, and as the moon grew smaller, I began to differentiate my sensations from one another. I gradually recognized the clear stream that refreshed me and the trees providing me with shade. I was delighted when I discovered that the pleasant sound often reaching my ears came from the little winged creatures that had sometimes blocked my view of the light. I started to notice the forms around me more accurately and discern the edges of the radiant ceiling of light above me. I tried to imitate the birds’ sweet songs, but I couldn’t manage it. Sometimes I wanted to express my feelings in my own way, but the strange, inarticulate sounds that escaped me frightened me into silence again.</p>\n<p>The moon had vanished from the night sky and then returned, appearing smaller, while I remained in the forest. By this time, my sensations had become distinct, and each day my mind gathered more ideas. My eyes adjusted to the light, allowing me to see objects clearly; I distinguished insects from plants, and gradually, one plant from another. I noticed that sparrows made harsh sounds, while blackbirds and thrushes sang sweetly.</p>\n<p>One day, feeling cold, I stumbled upon a fire left by some wandering beggars, and I was filled with joy at the warmth it offered. In my excitement, I reached out to touch the glowing embers but quickly pulled my hand back with a cry of pain. How strange, I thought, that the same thing could cause such different reactions! I examined the fire’s materials and was thrilled to discover it was made of wood. I quickly gathered some branches, but they were wet and wouldn’t light. This frustrated me, so I sat and watched the fire. The wet wood I had placed near the heat dried out and caught fire. I pondered this, and by touching the various branches, I figured out how it worked and busied myself collecting a large amount of wood to dry so I could have a steady supply of fire.</p>\n<p>When night fell and sleep came, I was terrified that my fire would go out. I carefully covered it with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches on top; then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and drifted off to sleep.</p>\n<p>Morning came, and my first concern was to check on the fire. I uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into flames. I noticed this and fashioned a fan from branches to stir the embers when they were nearly extinguished. When night descended again, I was delighted to find that the fire provided both light and warmth, and this discovery helped me with food. I found that some of the leftovers the travelers had left behind had been roasted, and they tasted much better than the berries I had gathered from the trees. So I tried to cook my food the same way, placing it on the hot embers. I discovered that the berries were ruined by this process, but the nuts and roots improved significantly.</p>\n<p>However, food became scarce, and I often spent the entire day searching in vain for a few acorns to ease my hunger. When I realized this, I resolved to leave the place I had been living in to find one where my few needs could be satisfied more easily. In this move, I deeply regretted losing the fire I had gained by accident and had no idea how to recreate it. I spent several hours seriously considering this problem, but I had to give up trying to maintain it, and wrapping myself in my cloak, I wandered through the woods toward the setting sun. I traveled for three days and finally discovered open land. A heavy snowfall had occurred the night before, and the fields were uniformly white; the scene felt disheartening, and I found my feet chilled by the cold, damp substance covering the ground.</p>\n<p>It was around seven in the morning, and I longed for food and shelter. Eventually, I spotted a small hut on a rise, likely built for the convenience of a shepherd. This was a new sight for me, and I examined the structure with great curiosity. Finding the door open, I entered. An old man sat inside near a fire, cooking his breakfast. He turned at the sound of my entry, saw me, and screamed loudly, fleeing across the fields with a speed his frail body hardly seemed capable of. His appearance, unlike anything I had ever seen, and his swift departure surprised me. But I was enchanted by the hut; here, snow and rain could not enter; the ground was dry; it seemed the most exquisite and divine retreat to me, like Pandæmonium to the demons of hell after their suffering in the lake of fire. I eagerly devoured the remnants of the shepherd’s breakfast, which included bread, cheese, milk, and wine; however, I didn’t like the wine. Then, exhausted, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep.</p>\n<p>I woke around noon, and lured by the warmth of the sun shining brightly on the white ground, I decided to continue my travels. After placing the remains of the peasant’s breakfast in a bag I found, I crossed the fields for several hours until I arrived at a village at sunset. It seemed miraculous! The huts, the tidy cottages, and the grand houses captivated me one after another. The vegetables in the gardens and the milk and cheese I saw placed at the windows of some cottages whetted my appetite.</p>\n<p>I entered one of the best cottages, but hardly had I stepped inside before the children screamed, and one of the women fainted. The whole village stirred; some ran away, some attacked me, and after being grievously pelted with stones and other projectiles, I fled to the open country and sought refuge in a low hovel, which looked miserable compared to the beautiful homes I had just seen. This hovel, however, was next to a neat and pleasant cottage, but after my painful experience, I dared not enter it. My refuge was made of wood, but it was so low that I could hardly sit upright. There was no wooden floor, just the dry earth beneath me, and although the wind entered through countless cracks, I found it a welcome shelter from the snow and rain.</p>\n<p>So, I retreated there, feeling happy to have found some shelter, however wretched, from the harsh weather and even more from the cruelty of man. As soon as morning broke, I crept out of my hideaway to see the nearby cottage and to figure out if I could stay in the shelter I had found. It was situated at the back of the cottage, surrounded by a pigsty and a clear pool of water. One part was open, and I had entered through that, but now I covered every gap through which I might be seen with stones and wood, leaving just enough space to move them if I needed to exit. All the light I had came through the sty, which was enough for me.</p>\n<p>Having arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I withdrew, for I saw a man’s figure in the distance, and I remembered too well how I had been treated the night before to trust myself in his presence. First, I secured my food for the day by taking a loaf of coarse bread and a cup which allowed me to drink more easily than from my hand, filled with the pure water flowing by my refuge. The floor was slightly raised, keeping it perfectly dry, and its proximity to the cottage’s chimney made it reasonably warm.</p>\n<p>With these provisions, I decided to stay in this hovel until something happened that might change my mind. Compared to the bleak forest where I used to live, with its rain-soaked branches and damp earth, this was indeed a paradise. I ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to fetch some water when I heard footsteps. Looking through a small crack, I saw a young girl carrying a pail on her head, passing by my hovel. She was young and gentle in demeanor, different from what I have since found cottagers and farm workers to be. Yet, she was poorly dressed, wearing a coarse blue skirt and a linen jacket as her only attire; her fair hair was braided but not decorated, and she looked both patient and sad.</p>\n<p>I lost sight of her, but about fifteen minutes later, she returned with the pail, now partly filled with milk. As she walked, seemingly struggling under the burden, a young man approached her, his face revealing deeper despair. He uttered a few words with a melancholy air, took the pail from her head, and carried it into the cottage himself. She followed him, and they disappeared. Soon after, I saw the young man again, this time with some tools in his hand, crossing the field behind the cottage, while the girl busied herself in and around the house.</p>\n<p>Upon examining my dwelling, I found that one of the cottage’s windows had once been part of it, but the panes had been filled with wood. In one of them was a small and nearly invisible crack through which I could barely see. Through this crevice, I could glimpse a small room, whitewashed and clean, though very sparsely furnished. In one corner, near a small fire, sat an old man, resting his head on his hands in a sorrowful position. The young girl was busy arranging the cottage, but soon she took something out of a drawer that kept her hands occupied, and she sat down next to the old man, who picked up an instrument and began to play, producing sounds sweeter than the songs of the thrush or the nightingale. It was a beautiful sight, even for me, a poor wretch who had never seen anything lovely before.</p>\n<p>The silver hair and kind face of the old cottager inspired my respect, while the gentle demeanor of the girl drew my affection. He played a sweet, mournful tune that I noticed brought tears to the eyes of his lovely companion, though the old man seemed unaware of this until she sobbed audibly. He then uttered a few words, and the fair girl knelt at his feet. He lifted her and smiled with such kindness and love that I felt a mix of pain and pleasure, sensations unlike anything I had ever experienced before, whether from hunger or cold, warmth or food. I withdrew from the window, unable to endure these feelings.</p>\n<p>Soon after, the young man returned with a load of wood on his shoulders. The girl met him at the door, helped him lighten his burden, and after taking some of the fuel inside, she and the young man went to a corner of the cottage, where he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese. She seemed pleased and went out to the garden for some roots and plants, which she placed in water and then on the fire. She then returned to her work, while the young man busied himself in the garden, digging and pulling up roots. After about an hour, the girl joined him, and together they entered the cottage.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, the old man had been lost in thought, but when his companions appeared, he brightened and they sat down to eat. Their meal was quickly finished. The young woman then resumed her work around the cottage, while the old man took a short walk outside in the sun, leaning on the arm of the young man. The contrast between these two remarkable beings was stunning. One was old, with silver hair and a face radiating kindness and love; the younger was slim and graceful, his features perfectly symmetrical, yet his eyes and posture conveyed deep sadness and despair.</p>\n<p>The old man returned inside, and the young man, now using different tools from the morning, headed across the fields. Night fell quickly, but to my amazement, I discovered that the cottagers had a way to extend the light using candles. I was thrilled to find that the setting sun didn’t end the joy I felt in observing my human neighbors. In the evening, the young girl and her companion engaged in various activities that I didn’t understand, while the old man picked up the instrument that had enchanted me earlier that morning. Once he finished, the young man began, not to play, but to produce monotonous sounds that were neither as harmonious as the old man’s music nor like the birds’ songs. I later learned he was reading aloud, but at that moment, I knew nothing of letters or words.</p>\n<p>After spending some time engaged in their activities, the family extinguished their lights and retired, as I guessed, to rest.</p>",

      "original": "<div class=\"chapter\" id=\"pgepubid00018\"> <h2><a id=\"chap12\">Chapter 12</a></h2><a id=\"chap12\"> <p> “I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep. I thought of the occurrences of the day. What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people, and I longed to join them, but dared not. I remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I would remain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions. </p>\n<p> “The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun. The young woman arranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departed after the first meal. </p>\n<p> “This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it. The young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in various laborious occupations within. The old man, whom I soon perceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument or in contemplation. Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion. They performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with gentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles. </p>\n<p> “They were not entirely happy. The young man and his companion often went apart and appeared to weep. I saw no cause for their unhappiness, but I was deeply affected by it. If such lovely creatures were miserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being, should be wretched. Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy? They possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands when hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more, they enjoyed one another’s company and speech, interchanging each day looks of affection and kindness. What did their tears imply? Did they really express pain? I was at first unable to solve these questions, but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which were at first enigmatic. </p>\n<p> “A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of the uneasiness of this amiable family: it was poverty, and they suffered that evil in a very distressing degree. Their nourishment consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of one cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters could scarcely procure food to support it. They often, I believe, suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two younger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old man when they reserved none for themselves. </p>\n<p> “This trait of kindness moved me sensibly. I had been accustomed, during the night, to steal a part of their store for my own consumption, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on the cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and roots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood. </p>\n<p> “I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist their labours. I found that the youth spent a great part of each day in collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night I often took his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home firing sufficient for the consumption of several days. </p>\n<p> “I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she opened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great pile of wood on the outside. She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the youth joined her, who also expressed surprise. I observed, with pleasure, that he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the cottage and cultivating the garden. </p>\n<p> “By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment. I found that these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by articulate sounds. I perceived that the words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the minds and countenances of the hearers. This was indeed a godlike science, and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it. But I was baffled in every attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick, and the words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible objects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the mystery of their reference. By great application, however, and after having remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse; I learned and applied the words, <i>fire, milk, bread,</i> and <i>wood.</i> I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves. The youth and his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only one, which was <i>father.</i> The girl was called <i>sister</i> or <i>Agatha,</i> and the youth <i>Felix, brother,</i> or <i>son</i>. I cannot describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds and was able to pronounce them. I distinguished several other words without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as <i>good, dearest, unhappy.</i> </p>\n<p> “I spent the winter in this manner. The gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys. I saw few human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my friends. The old man, I could perceive, often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that he called them, to cast off their melancholy. He would talk in a cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me. Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father. It was not thus with Felix. He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends. But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old man. </p>\n<p> “I could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked the dispositions of these amiable cottagers. In the midst of poverty and want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground. Early in the morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that obstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and brought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetual astonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible hand. In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner, yet brought no wood with him. At other times he worked in the garden, but as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old man and Agatha. </p>\n<p> “This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees I discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked. I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs for speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend these also; but how was that possible when I did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs? I improved, however, sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for I easily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become master of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted. </p>\n<p> “I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers—their grace, beauty, and delicate complexions; but how was I terrified when I viewed myself in a transparent pool! At first I started back, unable to believe that it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification. Alas! I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity. </p>\n<p> “As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow vanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth. From this time Felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications of impending famine disappeared. Their food, as I afterwards found, was coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it. Several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they dressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced. </p>\n<p> “The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did not rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters. This frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the earth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been. </p>\n<p> “My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the morning I attended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in various occupations, I slept; the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends. When they had retired to rest, if there was any moon or the night was star-light, I went into the woods and collected my own food and fuel for the cottage. When I returned, as often as it was necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and performed those offices that I had seen done by Felix. I afterwards found that these labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and once or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words <i>good spirit, wonderful</i>; but I did not then understand the signification of these terms. </p>\n<p> “My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the motives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to know why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad. I thought (foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people. When I slept or was absent, the forms of the venerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix flitted before me. I looked upon them as superior beings who would be the arbiters of my future destiny. I formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of me. I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle demeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour and afterwards their love. </p>\n<p> “These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art of language. My organs were indeed harsh, but supple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease. It was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved better treatment than blows and execration. </p>\n<p> “The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of the earth. Men who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of cultivation. The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves began to bud forth on the trees. Happy, happy earth! Fit habitation for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and unwholesome. My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil, and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy.” </p> </a></div>",
      "modern": "<p>Chapter 12</p>\n<p>I lay on my straw, unable to sleep. I thought about what had happened during the day. What struck me most was the gentle nature of these people, and I longed to join them, but I hesitated. I remembered too well the cruel treatment I received from the villagers the night before, and I decided that, regardless of what I might choose to do in the future, for now, I would stay quietly in my hovel, observing and trying to understand the reasons behind their actions.</p>\n<p>The cottagers woke the next morning before the sun rose. The young woman tidied up the cottage and prepared food, while the young man left after their first meal.</p>\n<p>That day followed the same routine as the one before. The young man was busy outside, while the girl engaged in various laborious tasks inside. The old man, whom I soon realized was blind, spent his free time playing his instrument or deep in thought. The love and respect the younger cottagers showed their elder were remarkable. They attended to him with affection and care, and he rewarded them with kind smiles.</p>\n<p>Yet, they were not entirely happy. The young man and his companion often wandered off together, appearing to weep. I couldn’t see the reason for their sadness, but it affected me deeply. If such beautiful beings were unhappy, it made sense that I, an imperfect and lonely creature, should feel miserable too. But why were these gentle souls in pain? They had a lovely home (at least, it seemed so to me) and every luxury; they had a fire to keep them warm when it was cold, and delicious food when they were hungry. They wore fine clothes and enjoyed each other’s company, exchanging looks of affection and kindness every day. What did their tears mean? Did they really express sorrow? At first, I couldn’t understand these questions, but over time, through constant observation, I began to unravel many of the mysteries that initially puzzled me.</p>\n<p>A significant amount of time passed before I discovered one reason for this amiable family's distress: poverty, which they faced in a very painful way. Their food came entirely from their garden and the milk of one cow, which provided very little during the winter when they could barely find enough to feed it. I often sensed that they experienced hunger quite severely, especially the two younger cottagers, as they sometimes set food before the old man while saving none for themselves.</p>\n<p>This act of kindness deeply touched me. I had been used to sneaking some of their food at night for my own sustenance, but when I realized that I was causing them pain, I refrained and settled for berries, nuts, and roots that I collected from a nearby forest.</p>\n<p>I also found another way to help them with their needs. I noticed that the young man spent a great deal of his time gathering wood for the family fire, and during the night, I would often take his tools, which I quickly learned to use, and bring back enough firewood to last several days.</p>\n<p>I remember the first time I did this; when the young woman opened the door in the morning, she looked astonished to see a large pile of wood outside. She exclaimed something loudly, and the young man joined her, also expressing surprise. I felt happy to see that he didn’t go to the forest that day but instead spent it repairing the cottage and tending to the garden.</p>\n<p>Gradually, I made an even more significant discovery. I realized that these people had a way of communicating their thoughts and feelings to one another through spoken words. I noticed that the words they used sometimes brought pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, to those who listened. This was indeed a godlike ability, and I desperately wanted to learn it. But every attempt I made to do so ended in frustration. Their speech was quick, and the words they spoke had no obvious connection to the visible objects around me, making it impossible for me to find a clue to unravel their meaning. However, after much effort and several months spent in my hovel, I finally learned the names of some common things; I could say fire, milk, bread, and wood. I also learned the names of the cottagers: the young man and his companion had several names, but the old man had only one—father. The girl was called sister or Agatha, and the young man was named Felix, brother, or son. I cannot express the joy I felt when I understood the meanings behind these sounds and could pronounce them. I recognized several other words, though I still didn’t understand their meanings or how to use them, such as good, dearest, and unhappy.</p>\n<p>I spent the winter in this way. The gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers endeared them to me; when they were sad, I felt downcast; when they were happy, I shared in their joy. I saw few other human beings besides them, and when anyone else entered the cottage, their harsh behavior and rough manner only highlighted the grace of my friends. I noticed that the old man often tried to uplift his children, as I sometimes overheard him call them, encouraging them to shake off their sadness. He spoke cheerfully, with a kindness that brought me joy as well. Agatha listened respectfully, her eyes sometimes filling with tears that she tried to wipe away unnoticed, but I found that her expression and tone were generally brighter after hearing her father’s words. Felix, however, seemed to be the saddest of the group, and even to my untrained senses, he appeared to suffer more than his companions. But if his face showed more sorrow, his voice was more cheerful than his sister’s, especially when he spoke to the old man.</p>\n<p>I could recount countless small instances that reflected the character of these wonderful cottagers. Despite their poverty and struggles, Felix took joy in bringing the first little white flower that peeked out from beneath the snow to his sister. Early in the morning, before she woke, he would clear the snow from her path to the milk house, draw water from the well, and fetch wood from the outhouse, where, to his endless surprise, he found his supply always replenished by an invisible hand. During the day, I believed he worked for a nearby farmer, as he often left and didn’t return until dinner, yet brought no wood back with him. At other times, he worked in the garden, but since there was little to do in the cold season, he read to the old man and Agatha.</p>\n<p>This reading puzzled me at first, but gradually I understood that the sounds he made while reading were the same as those he used in conversation. I speculated that he found signs on the paper that represented speech he understood, and I desperately wanted to learn these as well. But how could I do that when I didn’t even grasp the sounds that represented those signs? I made steady progress in this endeavor, but not enough to hold a conversation, even though I devoted all my energy to the task, for I realized that while I yearned to reveal myself to the cottagers, I shouldn't attempt it until I had mastered their language. This knowledge might help them overlook the ugliness of my appearance, which constantly haunted me.</p>\n<p>I admired the perfect forms of my cottagers—their grace, beauty, and delicate features. But I was horrified when I saw my reflection in a clear pool! At first, I jumped back, unable to believe that the figure staring back at me was truly me. When I finally accepted that I was the monster I had become, I was overwhelmed with despair and shame. Alas! I didn’t yet fully understand the tragic consequences of this wretched deformity.</p>\n<p>As the sun grew warmer and the days lengthened, the snow melted, revealing bare trees and dark earth. From this point on, Felix was busier, and the signs of looming famine faded. Their food, as I later learned, was simple, but wholesome, and they had enough to eat. New plants began to sprout in the garden, which they tended; these signs of comfort grew daily as the season progressed.</p>\n<p>The old man, leaning on his son, took daily walks at noon, weather permitting, as I learned to call it when the heavens poured rain. This happened often, but a strong wind quickly dried the ground, and the weather became much more pleasant.</p>\n<p>My life in the hovel was routine. In the mornings, I watched the cottagers, and when they scattered to their tasks, I would sleep. The rest of the day was spent observing my friends. When they went to bed, if the moon was out or the night was starry, I ventured into the woods to gather my own food and firewood. Upon my return, whenever necessary, I cleared their paths of snow and performed the tasks I had seen Felix do. I later discovered that these labors, done by an unseen hand, amazed them; I heard them occasionally say “good spirit” or “wonderful,” but at that time, I didn’t understand what those words meant.</p>\n<p>My thoughts became more active, and I yearned to understand the motives and feelings of these lovely beings; I was curious about why Felix looked so miserable and Agatha seemed so sad. I foolishly believed that I might be able to bring happiness back to these deserving people. When I closed my eyes or was away, the images of the venerable blind father, gentle Agatha, and excellent Felix danced before me. I saw them as superior beings who would determine my future fate. In my imagination, I created countless scenarios of presenting myself to them and how they would receive me. I imagined they would initially be repulsed, but that my gentle demeanor and conciliatory words would win their favor and eventually their love.</p>\n<p>These thoughts lifted my spirits and motivated me to pursue learning the art of language with renewed enthusiasm. My vocal cords were indeed rough, but pliable; and although my voice sounded nothing like the soft music of theirs, I managed to pronounce the words I understood with reasonable ease. It was as if I were a donkey trying to be a lapdog; yet surely the gentle donkey, despite its awkward manners, deserved better treatment than blows and scorn.</p>\n<p>The pleasant rains and warm spring weather transformed the landscape. People who had seemed to hide in caves emerged and engaged in various agricultural activities. The birds sang in brighter tones, and the trees began to bud. Happy, happy earth! A fitting home for gods, which only a short time ago was bleak, damp, and unhealthy. My spirits soared with the enchanting sights of nature; the past faded from my memory, the present was peaceful, and the future shone with bright rays of hope and anticipation of joy.</p>",

      "original": "<div class=\"chapter\" id=\"pgepubid00019\"> <h2><a id=\"chap13\">Chapter 13</a></h2><a id=\"chap13\"> <p> “I now hasten to the more moving part of my story. I shall relate events that impressed me with feelings which, from what I had been, have made me what I am. </p>\n<p> “Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies cloudless. It surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure. My senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and a thousand sights of beauty. </p>\n<p> “It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested from labour—the old man played on his guitar, and the children listened to him—that I observed the countenance of Felix was melancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once his father paused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired the cause of his son’s sorrow. Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door. </p>\n<p> “It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide. The lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black veil. Agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix. Her voice was musical but unlike that of either of my friends. On hearing this word, Felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression. Her hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were dark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with a lovely pink. </p>\n<p> “Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of sorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I thought him as beautiful as the stranger. She appeared affected by different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, as well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian. She did not appear to understand him, but smiled. He assisted her to dismount, and dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage. Some conversation took place between him and his father, and the young stranger knelt at the old man’s feet and would have kissed his hand, but he raised her and embraced her affectionately. </p>\n<p> “I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds and appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood by nor herself understood the cottagers. They made many signs which I did not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists. Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian. Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed the hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came. Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances, expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend. Presently I found, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language; and the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the same instructions to the same end. The stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which I had before understood, but I profited by the others. </p>\n<p> “As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early. When they separated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, ‘Good night sweet Safie.’ He sat up much longer, conversing with his father, and by the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their conversation. I ardently desired to understand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found it utterly impossible. </p>\n<p> “The next morning Felix went out to his work, and after the usual occupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the old man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes. She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or dying away like a nightingale of the woods. </p>\n<p> “When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first declined it. She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. The old man appeared enraptured and said some words which Agatha endeavoured to explain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music. </p>\n<p> “The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends. Safie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the knowledge of language, so that in two months I began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors. </p>\n<p> “In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods; the sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun, for I never ventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with the same treatment I had formerly endured in the first village which I entered. </p>\n<p> “My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily master the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than the Arabian, who understood very little and conversed in broken accents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word that was spoken. </p>\n<p> “While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters as it was taught to the stranger, and this opened before me a wide field for wonder and delight. </p>\n<p> “The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney’s <i>Ruins of Empires</i>. I should not have understood the purport of this book had not Felix, in reading it, given very minute explanations. He had chosen this work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the Eastern authors. Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave me an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different nations of the earth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous genius and mental activity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early Romans—of their subsequent degenerating—of the decline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, Christianity, and kings. I heard of the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over the hapless fate of its original inhabitants. </p>\n<p> “These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. Was man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so vicious and base? He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike. To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm. For a long time I could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or even why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and loathing. </p>\n<p> “Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me. While I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the Arabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me. I heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood. </p>\n<p> “The words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and unsullied descent united with riches. A man might be respected with only one of these advantages, but without either he was considered, except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few! And what was I? Of my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. I was, besides, endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even of the same nature as man. I was more agile than they and could subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs. When I looked around I saw and heard of none like me. Was I, then, a monster, a blot upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned? </p>\n<p> “I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with knowledge. Oh, that I had for ever remained in my native wood, nor known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat! </p>\n<p> “Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind when it has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock. I wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death—a state which I feared yet did not understand. I admired virtue and good feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers, but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except through means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of becoming one among my fellows. The gentle words of Agatha and the animated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me. The mild exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved Felix were not for me. Miserable, unhappy wretch! </p>\n<p> “Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply. I heard of the difference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children, how the father doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the older child, how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in the precious charge, how the mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge, of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which bind one human being to another in mutual bonds. </p>\n<p> “But where were my friends and relations? No father had watched my infant days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if they had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I distinguished nothing. From my earliest remembrance I had been as I then was in height and proportion. I had never yet seen a being resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me. What was I? The question again recurred, to be answered only with groans. </p>\n<p> “I will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me now to return to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various feelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated in additional love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in an innocent, half-painful self-deceit, to call them).” </p> </a></div>",
      "modern": "<p>Chapter 13</p>\n<p>I now want to move on to the more emotional part of my story. I will share events that deeply affected me, shaping me from who I was into who I am now.</p>\n<p>Spring was advancing quickly; the weather turned pleasant and the skies were clear. I was amazed that what had once been a desolate and gloomy landscape was now filled with the most beautiful flowers and greenery. My senses were delighted and refreshed by countless sweet scents and stunning sights.</p>\n<p>It was on one of these days, when my cottagers took a break from their work—the old man played his guitar while the children listened—that I noticed Felix’s face was filled with an indescribable sadness. He sighed frequently, and at one point, his father paused in his music, seeming to ask what was troubling his son. Felix replied cheerfully, and the old man began to play again when there was a knock at the door.</p>\n<p>A lady arrived on horseback, accompanied by a local man as a guide. She was dressed in dark clothing and wore a thick black veil. Agatha asked her a question, to which the stranger responded sweetly with the name Felix. Her voice was melodic but different from either of my friends'. Upon hearing this, Felix hurried to the lady, who lifted her veil, revealing a face of angelic beauty. Her hair was shining black, intricately braided; her eyes were dark yet gentle, full of life; her features were perfectly proportioned, and her complexion was remarkably fair, with a lovely pink tint on her cheeks.</p>\n<p>Felix looked utterly delighted upon seeing her; all traces of sorrow vanished from his face, replaced with ecstatic joy that I could hardly believe was possible. His eyes sparkled, and his cheeks flushed with pleasure; at that moment, I thought he looked as beautiful as the stranger. She seemed affected by different emotions; wiping away a few tears from her lovely eyes, she extended her hand to Felix, who kissed it with rapture and called her, as far as I could tell, his sweet Arabian. She didn’t seem to understand him, but she smiled. He helped her dismount, waved goodbye to her guide, and led her into the cottage. Some conversation took place between him and his father, and the young stranger knelt at the old man’s feet, attempting to kiss his hand, but he lifted her up and embraced her warmly.</p>\n<p>I soon realized that although the stranger spoke clearly and seemed to have her own language, she was neither understood by nor understood the cottagers. They made many signs that I couldn’t grasp, but I saw that her presence filled the cottage with happiness, chasing away their sadness like the sun dispersing morning mist. Felix appeared particularly joyful and welcomed his Arabian with smiles. Agatha, ever-gentle, kissed the hands of the lovely stranger and pointed to her brother, making gestures that I interpreted to mean that he had been sad until her arrival. Hours passed as they expressed joy through their faces, the reasons for which I couldn’t understand.</p>\n<p>Eventually, I noticed that the stranger frequently repeated a sound that the cottagers made, indicating she was trying to learn their language. This inspired me to use the same methods for my own learning. The stranger picked up about twenty words during the first lesson; most of them were ones I had already understood, but I benefited from the new ones.</p>\n<p>As night fell, Agatha and the Arabian went to bed early. When they parted, Felix kissed the stranger's hand and said, “Good night, sweet Safie.” He stayed up much longer, conversing with his father, and I suspected from the frequent mention of her name that their lovely guest was the focus of their conversation. I desperately wanted to understand them, pouring all my efforts into that goal, but I found it utterly impossible.</p>\n<p>The next morning, Felix went out to work, and after Agatha finished her usual chores, the Arabian sat at the old man’s feet. She took his guitar and played melodies so enchanting that they brought tears of both sorrow and joy to my eyes. She sang, her voice flowing with a rich cadence, rising and falling like a nightingale in the woods.</p>\n<p>When she finished, she handed the guitar to Agatha, who hesitated at first. Agatha played a simple tune, her voice accompanying it in sweet notes, but it was not as wondrous as the stranger's. The old man appeared captivated, saying something that Agatha tried to explain to Safie, and it seemed he wanted to express that her music brought him immense joy.</p>\n<p>The days passed peacefully, with the only change being that joy replaced the sadness on my friends' faces. Safie was always cheerful; she and I quickly improved in our language skills, so that within two months, I began to understand most of the words spoken by my protectors.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the barren ground was now covered in grass, and the green banks were dotted with countless flowers, sweet to the smell and pleasing to the eyes, like stars shining softly among the moonlit woods. The sun grew warmer, nights became clear and balmy, and my nighttime walks brought me great pleasure, although they were cut short by the later sunsets and earlier sunrises. I never ventured out during the day, fearing I would experience the same treatment I had in the first village I entered.</p>\n<p>I spent my days focused on mastering the language; I can proudly say I improved more rapidly than the Arabian, who understood very little and spoke in broken phrases, while I could grasp and imitate almost every word spoken.</p>\n<p>As I improved my speech, I also learned the art of writing as it was taught to the stranger, which opened up a vast world of wonder and delight for me.</p>\n<p>The book from which Felix taught Safie was Volney’s \"Ruins of Empires.\" I wouldn’t have understood its meaning if Felix hadn’t provided detailed explanations while reading. He chose this work because its style mimicked that of Eastern authors. Through it, I gained a cursory understanding of history and insight into the various empires existing in the world; it introduced me to the customs, governments, and religions of different nations. I learned about the lazy Asiatics, the astonishing intellect and creativity of the Greeks, the wars and virtues of early Romans, their later decline, the fall of that mighty empire, chivalry, Christianity, and kings. I heard about the discovery of the Americas and wept with Safie over the tragic fate of its original inhabitants.</p>\n<p>These wonderful stories stirred strange feelings within me. Was humanity truly so powerful, noble, and magnificent, yet also so wicked and base? At times, humans seemed like mere extensions of evil, while at other moments, they embodied everything noble and godlike. To be a great and virtuous person seemed the highest honor for any sensitive being, while to be base and vicious, as many had been, appeared the lowest degradation, more miserable than that of a blind mole or a harmless worm. For a long time, I couldn’t understand how one man could murder another or why there were laws and governments. But after hearing accounts of vice and bloodshed, my astonishment faded, and I turned away in disgust and revulsion.</p>\n<p>Every conversation among the cottagers revealed new wonders to me. As I listened to Felix instructing the Arabian, the complex structure of human society began to unfold. I learned about the division of property, immense wealth and extreme poverty, social rank, lineage, and noble blood.</p>\n<p>These words made me reflect on myself. I discovered that the possessions most valued by others were noble heritage combined with wealth. A man could be respected for having either one of these traits, but without both, he was usually seen, except in rare cases, as a vagabond or a slave, forced to spend his life working for the benefit of a chosen few! And what was I? I was completely ignorant of my creation and creator, but I knew that I had no money, no friends, no possessions. I was also cursed with a hideously deformed and repulsive appearance; I was not even of the same kind as humans. I was more agile than they and could survive on coarser food; I could endure extreme heat and cold with less harm to my body; my stature far exceeded theirs. When I looked around, I saw no one like me. Was I then a monster, a stain on the earth, from whom all men fled and whom all men rejected?</p>\n<p>I cannot express the agony these reflections caused me; I tried to push them away, but sorrow only deepened with knowledge. Oh, that I had remained forever in my native woods, feeling nothing beyond the basic sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!</p>\n<p>What a strange nature knowledge is! Once it takes hold of the mind, it clings to it like lichen on rock. I sometimes wished I could shake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was only one way to escape the sensation of pain, and that was death—a state I both feared and didn’t fully understand. I admired virtue and good feelings and loved the gentle manners and kind qualities of my cottagers, but I was shut out from interacting with them, except through means I acquired in secret, unseen and unknown, which only intensified my longing to be one of them. The gentle words of Agatha and the lively smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me. The kind encouragement of the old man and the animated conversations of dear Felix were not for me. Miserable, unhappy wretch!</p>\n<p>Other lessons weighed even more heavily on me. I learned about the differences between the sexes, the birth and growth of children, how fathers cherished the smiles of their infants, and how mothers devoted their lives and cares to their precious charges, how the minds of youth grew and gained knowledge, and the relationships of brother, sister, and the various bonds that connect one human to another.</p>\n<p>But where were my friends and family? No father watched over my early days; no mother blessed me with smiles and affection. If they had, all my past was now a blur, a dark void in which I recognized nothing. From my earliest memories, I had remained as I was, in height and proportion. I had never seen a being like me or anyone who sought to connect with me. What was I? The question returned, answered only with groans.</p>\n<p>I will soon explain where these feelings led me, but for now, I must return to the cottagers, whose story stirred in me such a mix of indignation, delight, and wonder, all culminating in a deeper love and respect for my protectors (for so I innocently, yet painfully, deceived myself into calling them).</p>",

      "original": "<div class=\"chapter\" id=\"pgepubid00020\"> <h2><a id=\"chap14\">Chapter 14</a></h2><a id=\"chap14\"> <p> “Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends. It was one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding as it did a number of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to one so utterly inexperienced as I was. </p>\n<p> “The name of the old man was De Lacey. He was descended from a good family in France, where he had lived for many years in affluence, respected by his superiors and beloved by his equals. His son was bred in the service of his country, and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction. A few months before my arrival they had lived in a large and luxurious city called Paris, surrounded by friends and possessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or taste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford. </p>\n<p> “The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin. He was a Turkish merchant and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some reason which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government. He was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from Constantinople to join him. He was tried and condemned to death. The injustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant; and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime alleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation. </p>\n<p> “Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the court. He made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him and then looked around for the means. After many fruitless attempts to gain admittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an unguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate Muhammadan, who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the execution of the barbarous sentence. Felix visited the grate at night and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour. The Turk, amazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer by promises of reward and wealth. Felix rejected his offers with contempt, yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard. </p>\n<p> “The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made on the heart of Felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he should be conveyed to a place of safety. Felix was too delicate to accept this offer, yet he looked forward to the probability of the event as to the consummation of his happiness. </p>\n<p> “During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for the escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several letters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man, a servant of her father who understood French. She thanked him in the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent, and at the same time she gently deplored her own fate. </p>\n<p> “I have copies of these letters, for I found means, during my residence in the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters were often in the hands of Felix or Agatha. Before I depart I will give them to you; they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present, as the sun is already far declined, I shall only have time to repeat the substance of them to you. </p>\n<p> “Safie related that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a slave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart of the father of Safie, who married her. The young girl spoke in high and enthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the bondage to which she was now reduced. She instructed her daughter in the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female followers of Muhammad. This lady died, but her lessons were indelibly impressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again returning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem, allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill-suited to the temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation for virtue. The prospect of marrying a Christian and remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in society was enchanting to her. </p>\n<p> “The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed, but on the night previous to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant many leagues from Paris. Felix had procured passports in the name of his father, sister, and himself. He had previously communicated his plan to the former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under the pretence of a journey and concealed himself, with his daughter, in an obscure part of Paris. </p>\n<p> “Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and across Mont Cenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable opportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions. </p>\n<p> “Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his departure, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she should be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in expectation of that event; and in the meantime he enjoyed the society of the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest affection. They conversed with one another through the means of an interpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and Safie sang to him the divine airs of her native country. </p>\n<p> “The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes of the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other plans. He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a Christian, but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should appear lukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer if he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they inhabited. He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed. His plans were facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris. </p>\n<p> “The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their victim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer. The plot of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were thrown into prison. The news reached Felix and roused him from his dream of pleasure. His blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of her whom he loved. This idea was torture to him. He quickly arranged with the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity for escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a boarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian, he hastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the law, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding. </p>\n<p> “He did not succeed. They remained confined for five months before the trial took place, the result of which deprived them of their fortune and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country. </p>\n<p> “They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I discovered them. Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for whom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin, became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy with his daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him, as he said, in some plan of future maintenance. </p>\n<p> “Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and rendered him, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family. He could have endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of his virtue, he gloried in it; but the ingratitude of the Turk and the loss of his beloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable. The arrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul. </p>\n<p> “When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealth and rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her lover, but to prepare to return to her native country. The generous nature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to expostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his tyrannical mandate. </p>\n<p> “A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter’s apartment and told her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the French government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to Constantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours. He intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential servant, to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his property, which had not yet arrived at Leghorn. </p>\n<p> “When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it would become her to pursue in this emergency. A residence in Turkey was abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike averse to it. By some papers of her father which fell into her hands she heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where he then resided. She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her determination. Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a sum of money, she quitted Italy with an attendant, a native of Leghorn, but who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed for Germany. </p>\n<p> “She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage of De Lacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill. Safie nursed her with the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died, and the Arabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world. She fell, however, into good hands. The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for which they were bound, and after her death the woman of the house in which they had lived took care that Safie should arrive in safety at the cottage of her lover.” </p> </a></div>",
      "modern": "<p>Chapter 14</p>\n<p>Some time passed before I learned the story of my friends. Their tale was one that deeply impressed me, revealing many circumstances that were both interesting and extraordinary to someone as inexperienced as I was.</p>\n<p>The old man's name was De Lacey. He came from a respectable family in France, where he had lived for many years in comfort, respected by those above him and loved by his peers. His son had served his country, and Agatha had associated with the most distinguished ladies. A few months before I arrived, they had lived in a grand city called Paris, surrounded by friends and enjoying all the pleasures that virtue, refined intellect, and taste, combined with a moderate fortune, could provide.</p>\n<p>The father of Safie was the reason for their downfall. He was a Turkish merchant who had lived in Paris for many years. For some reason I couldn't learn, he became a target of the government. On the very day that Safie arrived from Constantinople to join him, he was seized and thrown into prison. He was tried and condemned to death. The injustice of his sentence was glaring; all of Paris was outraged, and it was believed that his religion and wealth, rather than any crime he committed, were the real reasons for his condemnation.</p>\n<p>Felix had accidentally attended the trial, and his horror and outrage were uncontrollable when he heard the court's decision. In that moment, he made a solemn vow to rescue him and immediately began looking for a way to do so. After many unsuccessful attempts to gain access to the prison, he found a heavily barred window in an unguarded part of the building that lit the dungeon of the unfortunate man, who, burdened with chains, awaited the execution of the cruel sentence. Felix visited the grate at night to share his intentions with the prisoner. The Turk, astonished and overjoyed, tried to spark Felix’s enthusiasm with promises of reward and wealth. Felix rejected his offers with disdain, but when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit her father and expressed her deep gratitude through gestures, he couldn’t deny to himself that the captive held a treasure that would fully reward his efforts and risks.</p>\n<p>The Turk quickly noticed the effect his daughter had on Felix and tried to secure him further by promising her hand in marriage once he was safely out of prison. Felix, being too noble to accept such an offer, still looked forward to the possibility of that event as the fulfillment of his happiness.</p>\n<p>In the following days, as preparations were made for the merchant’s escape, Felix was encouraged by several letters from the lovely girl, who managed to express her thoughts in the language of her lover with the help of an old servant of her father who understood French. She thanked him earnestly for his planned efforts to help her father, while also lamenting her own situation.</p>\n<p>I have copies of these letters, as I managed to obtain writing materials during my stay in the hovel, and the letters often passed through the hands of Felix or Agatha. Before I leave, I will share them with you; they will prove the truth of my story. But for now, as the sun has already set, I will summarize their contents for you.</p>\n<p>Safie wrote that her mother was a Christian Arab, captured and enslaved by the Turks. Noted for her beauty, she won the heart of Safie’s father, who married her. The young girl spoke passionately about her mother, who, born in freedom, rejected the bondage she now faced. She taught her daughter the principles of her faith and inspired her to pursue higher intellectual powers and an independent spirit, which were denied to the female followers of Muhammad. This woman passed away, but her teachings remained firmly planted in Safie’s mind, making her dread the thought of returning to Asia and being confined within the walls of a harem, limited to childish distractions unworthy of her spirit, which was now accustomed to lofty ideas and a noble pursuit of virtue. The idea of marrying a Christian and living in a country where women had a place in society was thrilling to her.</p>\n<p>The execution of the Turk was scheduled, but on the night before, he escaped from prison and was far from Paris by morning. Felix had obtained passports in the names of himself, his father, and his sister. He had previously informed his father of his plan, who aided the deception by leaving their home under the pretense of a trip and hiding himself with his daughter in a secluded part of Paris.</p>\n<p>Felix guided the fugitives through France to Lyons and over Mont Cenis to Leghorn, where the merchant planned to wait for an opportunity to reach some part of the Turkish territories.</p>\n<p>Safie decided to stay with her father until his departure, during which the Turk renewed his promise that she would marry her rescuer. Felix remained with them, anticipating that event, and in the meantime enjoyed the company of the Arabian girl, who showed him the simplest and most tender affection. They communicated through an interpreter and sometimes with glances; Safie even sang to him the beautiful songs of her homeland.</p>\n<p>The Turk allowed this closeness to develop and nurtured the hopes of the young lovers, while secretly harboring different plans. He detested the idea of his daughter marrying a Christian but feared Felix's wrath if he appeared indifferent since he knew he was still at the mercy of Felix, who could betray him to the Italian authorities. He devised numerous schemes to prolong the deception until it was no longer necessary and intended to take his daughter with him when he left. His plans were aided by news from Paris.</p>\n<p>The French government was furious about the escape of their prisoner and spared no effort to find and punish his rescuer. Felix's plot was soon uncovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were imprisoned. The news reached Felix and jolted him from his blissful reverie. His blind and elderly father and gentle sister were locked in a filthy dungeon while he enjoyed freedom and the company of the woman he loved. This thought tormented him. He quickly arranged with the Turk that if the latter found a good opportunity to escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should stay at a convent in Leghorn; then, leaving the beautiful Arabian, he rushed to Paris and surrendered himself to the law, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha with this move.</p>\n<p>He did not succeed. They remained imprisoned for five months before their trial, which resulted in their losing their fortune and being condemned to permanent exile from their homeland.</p>\n<p>They found a miserable refuge in the cottage in Germany, where I discovered them. Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for whom he and his family had suffered such unheard-of oppression, had abandoned Italy with his daughter and, upon realizing Felix's reduced circumstances, sent him a paltry sum of money, claiming it was to help him plan for his future.</p>\n<p>Such were the events that tormented Felix's heart and made him, when I first met him, the most miserable of his family. He could have borne poverty, and while this distress was the result of his virtue, he took pride in it. But the Turk's ingratitude and the loss of his beloved Safie were far more bitter and irreparable misfortunes. The arrival of the Arabian girl now reignited hope in his soul.</p>\n<p>When news reached Leghorn that Felix had lost his wealth and status, the merchant ordered his daughter to forget her lover and prepare to return to her homeland. Safie's generous spirit was outraged by this command; she tried to reason with her father, but he angrily left her, repeating his tyrannical order.</p>\n<p>A few days later, the Turk entered his daughter's room and hurriedly told her he had reason to believe that his location in Leghorn had been discovered and that he would soon be handed over to the French authorities. He had therefore hired a ship to take him to Constantinople and would depart in a few hours. He planned to leave his daughter in the care of a trusted servant, who would follow later with most of his possessions, which had not yet reached Leghorn.</p>\n<p>Once alone, Safie resolved to determine her course of action in this emergency. Living in Turkey was abhorrent to her; both her beliefs and her feelings opposed it. From some papers of her father that came into her possession, she learned of her lover's exile and discovered where he was staying. She hesitated for a time, but eventually made her decision. Taking some jewels and a sum of money that belonged to her, she left Italy with a servant, a native of Leghorn who spoke the common language of Turkey, and set off for Germany.</p>\n<p>She arrived safely at a town about twenty leagues from De Lacey's cottage when her attendant fell gravely ill. Safie cared for her with devoted affection, but the poor girl died, leaving the Arabian alone, unfamiliar with the country's language and completely ignorant of the world's customs. However, she fell into good hands. The Italian had mentioned the name of their destination, and after the attendant's death, the woman of the house where they had stayed made sure that Safie arrived safely at her lover's cottage.</p>",

      "original": "<div class=\"chapter\" id=\"pgepubid00021\"> <h2><a id=\"chap15\">Chapter 15</a></h2><a id=\"chap15\"> <p> “Such was the history of my beloved cottagers. It impressed me deeply. I learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admire their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind. </p>\n<p> “As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and generosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities were called forth and displayed. But in giving an account of the progress of my intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred in the beginning of the month of August of the same year. </p>\n<p> “One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and some books. I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel. Fortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which I had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of <i>Paradise Lost</i>, a volume of <i>Plutarch’s Lives</i>, and the <i>Sorrows of Werter</i>. The possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continually studied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were employed in their ordinary occupations. </p>\n<p> “I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. They produced in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. In the <i>Sorrows of Werter</i>, besides the interest of its simple and affecting story, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a never-ending source of speculation and astonishment. The gentle and domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and feelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which were for ever alive in my own bosom. But I thought Werter himself a more divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character contained no pretension, but it sank deep. The disquisitions upon death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder. I did not pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards the opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely understanding it. </p>\n<p> “As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and condition. I found myself similar yet at the same time strangely unlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I was a listener. I sympathised with and partly understood them, but I was unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to none. ‘The path of my departure was free,’ and there was none to lament my annihilation. My person was hideous and my stature gigantic. What did this mean? Who was I? What was I? Whence did I come? What was my destination? These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to solve them. </p>\n<p> “The volume of <i>Plutarch’s Lives</i> which I possessed contained the histories of the first founders of the ancient republics. This book had a far different effect upon me from the <i>Sorrows of Werter</i>. I learned from Werter’s imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarch taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages. Many things I read surpassed my understanding and experience. I had a very confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers, and boundless seas. But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and large assemblages of men. The cottage of my protectors had been the only school in which I had studied human nature, but this book developed new and mightier scenes of action. I read of men concerned in public affairs, governing or massacring their species. I felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they were, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by these feelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa, Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus. The patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should have been imbued with different sensations. </p>\n<p> “But <i>Paradise Lost</i> excited different and far deeper emotions. I read it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as a true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of exciting. I often referred the several situations, as their similarity struck me, to my own. Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine in every other respect. He had come forth from the hands of God a perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of his Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone. Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter gall of envy rose within me. </p>\n<p> “Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings. Soon after my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of the dress which I had taken from your laboratory. At first I had neglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in which they were written, I began to study them with diligence. It was your journal of the four months that preceded my creation. You minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress of your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic occurrences. You doubtless recollect these papers. Here they are. Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances which produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious and loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own horrors and rendered mine indelible. I sickened as I read. ‘Hateful day when I received life!’ I exclaimed in agony. ‘Accursed creator! Why did you form a monster so hideous that even <i>you</i> turned from me in disgust? God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the very resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire and encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred.’ </p>\n<p> “These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude; but when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and benevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity. Could they turn from their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion and friendship? I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate. I postponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importance attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail. Besides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every day’s experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking until a few more months should have added to my sagacity. </p>\n<p> “Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage. The presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I also found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there. Felix and Agatha spent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in their labours by servants. They did not appear rich, but they were contented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, while mine became every day more tumultuous. Increase of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was. I cherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my person reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail image and that inconstant shade. </p>\n<p> “I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial which in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my feelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed smiles of consolation. But it was all a dream; no Eve soothed my sorrows nor shared my thoughts; I was alone. I remembered Adam’s supplication to his Creator. But where was mine? He had abandoned me, and in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him. </p>\n<p> “Autumn passed thus. I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay and fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it had worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon. Yet I did not heed the bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my conformation for the endurance of cold than heat. But my chief delights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay apparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention towards the cottagers. Their happiness was not decreased by the absence of summer. They loved and sympathised with one another; and their joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the casualties that took place around them. The more I saw of them, the greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; to see their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost limit of my ambition. I dared not think that they would turn them from me with disdain and horror. The poor that stopped at their door were never driven away. I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a little food or rest: I required kindness and sympathy; but I did not believe myself utterly unworthy of it. </p>\n<p> “The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken place since I awoke into life. My attention at this time was solely directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my protectors. I revolved many projects, but that on which I finally fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone. I had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly beheld me. My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I thought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children I could gain the good will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might by his means be tolerated by my younger protectors. </p>\n<p> “One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground and diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha, and Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own desire, was left alone in the cottage. When his children had departed, he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more sweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before. At first his countenance was illuminated with pleasure, but as he continued, thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the instrument, he sat absorbed in reflection. </p>\n<p> “My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which would decide my hopes or realise my fears. The servants were gone to a neighbouring fair. All was silent in and around the cottage; it was an excellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my limbs failed me and I sank to the ground. Again I rose, and exerting all the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat. The fresh air revived me, and with renewed determination I approached the door of their cottage. </p>\n<p> “I knocked. ‘Who is there?’ said the old man. ‘Come in.’ </p>\n<p> “I entered. ‘Pardon this intrusion,’ said I; ‘I am a traveller in want of a little rest; you would greatly oblige me if you would allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire.’ </p>\n<p> “‘Enter,’ said De Lacey, ‘and I will try in what manner I can to relieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my children are from home, and as I am blind, I am afraid I shall find it difficult to procure food for you.’ </p>\n<p> “‘Do not trouble yourself, my kind host; I have food; it is warmth and rest only that I need.’ </p>\n<p> “I sat down, and a silence ensued. I knew that every minute was precious to me, yet I remained irresolute in what manner to commence the interview, when the old man addressed me. </p>\n<p> ‘By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman; are you French?’ </p>\n<p> “‘No; but I was educated by a French family and understand that language only. I am now going to claim the protection of some friends, whom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some hopes.’ </p>\n<p> “‘Are they Germans?’ </p>\n<p> “‘No, they are French. But let us change the subject. I am an unfortunate and deserted creature, I look around and I have no relation or friend upon earth. These amiable people to whom I go have never seen me and know little of me. I am full of fears, for if I fail there, I am an outcast in the world for ever.’ </p>\n<p> “‘Do not despair. To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate, but the hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest, are full of brotherly love and charity. Rely, therefore, on your hopes; and if these friends are good and amiable, do not despair.’ </p>\n<p> “‘They are kind—they are the most excellent creatures in the world; but, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me. I have good dispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree beneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they ought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestable monster.’ </p>\n<p> “‘That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, cannot you undeceive them?’ </p>\n<p> “‘I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that I feel so many overwhelming terrors. I tenderly love these friends; I have, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily kindness towards them; but they believe that I wish to injure them, and it is that prejudice which I wish to overcome.’ </p>\n<p> “‘Where do these friends reside?’ </p>\n<p> “‘Near this spot.’ </p>\n<p> “The old man paused and then continued, ‘If you will unreservedly confide to me the particulars of your tale, I perhaps may be of use in undeceiving them. I am blind and cannot judge of your countenance, but there is something in your words which persuades me that you are sincere. I am poor and an exile, but it will afford me true pleasure to be in any way serviceable to a human creature.’ </p>\n<p> “‘Excellent man! I thank you and accept your generous offer. You raise me from the dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your aid, I shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow creatures.’ </p>\n<p> “‘Heaven forbid! Even if you were really criminal, for that can only drive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue. I also am unfortunate; I and my family have been condemned, although innocent; judge, therefore, if I do not feel for your misfortunes.’ </p>\n<p> “‘How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor? From your lips first have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I shall be for ever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success with those friends whom I am on the point of meeting.’ </p>\n<p> “‘May I know the names and residence of those friends?’ </p>\n<p> “I paused. This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to rob me of or bestow happiness on me for ever. I struggled vainly for firmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my remaining strength; I sank on the chair and sobbed aloud. At that moment I heard the steps of my younger protectors. I had not a moment to lose, but seizing the hand of the old man, I cried, ‘Now is the time! Save and protect me! You and your family are the friends whom I seek. Do not you desert me in the hour of trial!’ </p>\n<p> “‘Great God!’ exclaimed the old man. ‘Who are you?’ </p>\n<p> “At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, and Agatha entered. Who can describe their horror and consternation on beholding me? Agatha fainted, and Safie, unable to attend to her friend, rushed out of the cottage. Felix darted forward, and with supernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung, in a transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently with a stick. I could have torn him limb from limb, as the lion rends the antelope. But my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness, and I refrained. I saw him on the point of repeating his blow, when, overcome by pain and anguish, I quitted the cottage, and in the general tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel.” </p> </a></div>",
      "modern": "<p>Chapter 15</p>\n<p>This was the story of my dear cottagers. It affected me deeply. From their experiences, I learned to appreciate their virtues and to criticize the vices of humanity.</p>\n<p>At that time, I saw crime as something distant; kindness and generosity were always present in my mind, fueling my desire to become part of the vibrant scene where so many admirable qualities were displayed. However, in recounting my intellectual growth, I must mention an event that took place at the beginning of August that year.</p>\n<p>One night, during my usual visit to the nearby woods to gather food and firewood for my protectors, I stumbled upon a leather suitcase containing several pieces of clothing and some books. I eagerly grabbed it and returned to my hovel. Fortunately, the books were in a language I had learned from the cottage; they included *Paradise Lost*, a volume of Plutarch’s *Lives*, and *The Sorrows of Werter*. Owning these treasures brought me immense joy; I spent countless hours studying and reflecting on these works while my friends went about their daily tasks.</p>\n<p>I can hardly describe the effect these books had on me. They filled my mind with countless new images and feelings that sometimes lifted me to ecstasy but more often plunged me into deep despair. In *The Sorrows of Werter*, the simple yet moving story, along with the many opinions discussed and the insights into previously obscure subjects, became an endless source of wonder and contemplation for me. The gentle, domestic life it depicted, coupled with high sentiments and feelings aimed at something beyond oneself, resonated with my experiences among my protectors and echoed the desires within my own heart. I found Werter himself to be a more divine being than I had ever seen or imagined; his character was free of pretense, yet it struck me deeply. The discussions on death and suicide filled me with awe. I didn’t claim to understand the nuances of these debates, yet I leaned toward the hero’s views, mourning his death even without fully grasping its implications.</p>\n<p>As I read, I couldn’t help but relate the stories to my own feelings and circumstances. I saw similarities between myself and the characters I read about, yet I also felt oddly disconnected from them. I empathized with them and partially understood their struggles, but my mind was still unformed; I was dependent on no one and connected to no one. \"The path of my departure was free,\" and there was no one to mourn my absence. My appearance was grotesque, and my stature was imposing. What did this mean? Who was I? What was I? Where did I come from? What was my purpose? These questions haunted me, but I could not find answers.</p>\n<p>The volume of Plutarch’s *Lives* I had acquired contained the stories of the founders of ancient republics. This book impacted me very differently than *The Sorrows of Werter*. From Werter’s thoughts, I learned about despair and sadness, but Plutarch inspired me with noble ideas; he lifted me above my own miserable reflections to admire and love the heroes of history. Many things I read went beyond my understanding and experience. I had a vague notion of kingdoms, vast lands, mighty rivers, and endless seas. However, I was completely unfamiliar with cities and large gatherings of people. The cottage of my protectors had been the only place where I learned about humanity, but this book opened up new and grander scenes of action. I read about men involved in public affairs, either governing or slaughtering their fellow humans. A strong desire for virtue arose within me, along with a disdain for vice—though I understood these terms only in relation to pleasure and pain. Driven by these feelings, I found myself admiring peaceful lawgivers like Numa, Solon, and Lycurgus over figures like Romulus and Theseus. The patriarchal lives of my protectors solidified these impressions in my mind; perhaps if my first encounter with humanity had been with a young soldier eager for glory and bloodshed, my feelings would have been different.</p>\n<p>But *Paradise Lost* stirred even deeper emotions within me. I read it, just as I had the other books that came into my possession, as if it were true history. It stirred every feeling of wonder and awe that the idea of an all-powerful God battling with His creations could evoke. I often related various situations in the story to my own. Like Adam, I seemed to have no connection to any other being in existence; but his situation was vastly different from mine in every other aspect. He had emerged from the hands of God as a perfect being, happy and thriving, under the special care of his Creator; he was allowed to converse with and learn from beings of a higher nature, but I was miserable, helpless, and alone. Many times I considered Satan a more fitting representation of my condition, for often, like him, when I observed the happiness of my protectors, the bitter sting of envy rose within me.</p>\n<p>Another event reinforced these feelings. Shortly after I arrived at the hovel, I discovered some papers in the pocket of the clothing I had taken from your laboratory. Initially, I had ignored them, but now that I could decipher the characters, I began to study them intently. They were your journal entries from the four months leading up to my creation. You meticulously described each step you took in your work, mixed with accounts of domestic events. You surely remember these papers. Here they are. They detail everything related to my cursed origin; the entire series of disgusting circumstances that led to it is laid bare, along with a vivid description of my hideous and loathsome body, written in language that conveyed your own horror and made mine unforgettable. I felt sick as I read. \"Hateful day when I received life!\" I cried in agony. \"Accursed creator! Why did you make a monster so grotesque that even you turned away from me in disgust? God, in His mercy, made man beautiful and appealing, after His own image; but my form is a filthy reflection of yours, even more horrible because of the resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow devils to admire and support him, but I am alone and reviled.\"</p>\n<p>These were the thoughts that consumed me during my hours of despair and solitude; yet when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their kind and compassionate natures, I convinced myself that once they learned of my admiration for them, they would pity me and overlook my physical deformity. Could they really turn away someone, however monstrous, who sought their compassion and friendship? I resolved, at the very least, not to give up hope, but to prepare myself for a meeting with them that would determine my fate. I postponed this attempt for several months, for the stakes felt so high that I dreaded the possibility of failure. Additionally, I noticed my understanding improved with each passing day, and I wanted to wait until I had gained more wisdom before embarking on this endeavor.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, several changes took place in the cottage. The arrival of Safie brought happiness to its inhabitants, and I noticed a greater abundance there. Felix and Agatha spent more time enjoying each other’s company, and they were assisted in their tasks by servants. They didn’t seem wealthy, but they were content and happy; their feelings were calm and serene, while mine grew ever more tumultuous. My growing knowledge only made me more acutely aware of my own wretchedness. I held onto hope, it’s true, but it vanished whenever I caught sight of my reflection in water or my shadow in the moonlight, as fleeting as those images were.</p>\n<p>I tried to suppress these fears and prepare myself for the trial I was determined to undertake in a few months; at times, I let my thoughts wander unchecked into fantasies of Paradise and dared to imagine kind and lovely beings sympathizing with my feelings and easing my sorrow; their angelic faces radiated smiles of comfort. But it was all just a dream; no Eve soothed my woes or shared my thoughts; I was utterly alone. I remembered Adam’s plea to his Creator. But where was mine? He had forsaken me, and in my heart’s bitterness, I cursed him.</p>\n<p>Thus autumn passed. I watched, with surprise and sorrow, as the leaves decayed and fell, and nature once again took on the barren, bleak appearance it had worn when I first saw the woods and the lovely moon. Yet I didn’t mind the harshness of the season; my body was better suited to endure the cold than the heat. My greatest joys had been the sight of flowers, birds, and the colorful garb of summer; when those faded, I turned my attention more towards the cottagers. Their happiness wasn’t diminished by summer’s absence. They loved and cared for one another; their joy, rooted in each other, remained unbroken by the misfortunes that surrounded them. The more I observed them, the stronger my wish grew to seek their protection and kindness; my heart ached to be known and loved by these gentle beings; to see their sweet faces turned towards me with affection was the pinnacle of my ambition. I dared not think that they would reject me with disdain and horror. The poor who came to their door were never turned away. I asked, it’s true, for greater treasures than just food or rest: I needed kindness and understanding; but I believed I was not entirely unworthy of it.</p>\n<p>Winter came, and an entire cycle of seasons had passed since I first came to life. My focus during this time was entirely on my plan to introduce myself to the cottage where my protectors lived. I considered many strategies, but the one I settled on was to approach the house when the blind old man was alone. I had the insight to realize that the unnatural horror of my appearance was the main source of fear for those who had seen me before. My voice, though harsh, held nothing terrifying in it; therefore, I thought if I could win the goodwill and mediation of the old De Lacey in the absence of his children, perhaps with his help, I could be accepted by my younger protectors.</p>\n<p>One day, when the sun illuminated the red leaves scattered on the ground and filled the air with cheer, though it offered no warmth, Safie, Agatha, and Felix set out on a long walk, leaving the old man alone in the cottage at his own request. After they left, he picked up his guitar and played several mournful yet beautiful tunes, more moving than I had ever heard him play before. Initially, his face lit up with joy, but as he continued, a pensive sadness replaced it; eventually, he set the instrument aside and sat lost in thought.</p>\n<p>My heart raced; this was the moment of trial that would determine my hopes or confirm my fears. The servants had gone to a nearby fair. All was quiet in and around the cottage; it was the perfect opportunity. Yet, as I moved to put my plan into action, my limbs faltered, and I collapsed to the ground. I rose again, summoning all my courage, and removed the planks I had placed in front of my hovel to hide my retreat. The fresh air revived me, and with renewed determination, I approached the door of their cottage.</p>\n<p>I knocked. \"Who is there?\" asked the old man. \"Come in.\"</p>\n<p>I entered. \"Please forgive this intrusion,\" I said; \"I am a traveler in need of a little rest; it would greatly help me if you would allow me to stay for a few minutes by the fire.\"</p>\n<p>\"Enter,\" said De Lacey, \"and I will do my best to meet your needs; but unfortunately, my children are away, and as I am blind, I may find it difficult to provide you with food.\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't worry, kind host; I have food; all I need is warmth and a place to rest.\"</p>\n<p>I sat down, and silence fell between us. I knew that every second was valuable, yet I hesitated on how to start our conversation when the old man spoke. \"From your language, stranger, I assume you are from my country; are you French?\"</p>\n<p>\"No; but I was raised by a French family and only understand that language. I am about to seek the protection of some friends, whom I truly love, and I have some hope of their favor.\"</p>\n<p>\"Are they Germans?\"</p>\n<p>\"No, they are French. But let’s change the subject. I am an unfortunate and abandoned creature; I look around and have no relatives or friends in this world. These kind people I am going to see have never met me and know little about me. I am filled with fears, for if I fail there, I will be an outcast forever.\"</p>\n<p>\"Do not lose hope. To be without friends is indeed unfortunate, but the hearts of people, when not influenced by self-interest, are full of love and charity. So rely on your hopes, and if these friends are good and kind, do not despair.\"</p>\n<p>\"They are kind—they are the most wonderful beings in the world; but, unfortunately, they have prejudices against me. I have good intentions; my life has been harmless and even somewhat beneficial; yet a fatal prejudice blinds their eyes, and where they should see a caring and loving friend, they only see a dreadful monster.\"</p>\n<p>\"That is indeed unfortunate; but if you truly are blameless, can’t you undeceive them?\"</p>\n<p>\"I am about to undertake that very task; and that is why I feel so overwhelmed with fear. I love these friends dearly; for months, I have, without their knowledge, been performing acts of kindness towards them; but they believe I wish to harm them, and it is this prejudice I wish to overcome.\"</p>\n<p>\"Where do these friends live?\"</p>\n<p>\"Nearby.\"</p>\n<p>The old man paused and then continued, \"If you share the details of your story with me, perhaps I can help clear up their misconceptions. I am blind and cannot judge your appearance, but there is something in your words that convinces me of your sincerity. I am poor and an exile, but I would find true pleasure in being of service to another human being.\"</p>\n<p>\"Excellent man! I thank you and gladly accept your generous offer. You lift me from despair with your kindness; and I trust that, with your help, I will not be rejected by the company and compassion of my fellow creatures.\"</p>\n<p>\"Heaven forbid! Even if you were truly criminal, that would only drive you to desperation, not inspire you to virtue. I, too, am unfortunate; my family and I have been condemned, although innocent; judge for yourself if I do not sympathize with your misfortunes.\"</p>\n<p>\"How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor? You are the first to speak words of kindness to me; I will be forever grateful, and your current compassion assures me of success with the friends I am about to meet.\"</p>\n<p>\"May I know the names and address of these friends?\"</p>\n<p>I hesitated. This, I thought, was the moment that would either rob me of happiness or grant it to me forever. I struggled in vain for the strength to answer, but the effort drained all my remaining resolve; I sank into the chair and sobbed. Just then, I heard the footsteps of my younger protectors. I had no time to lose, and seizing the old man’s hand, I cried, \"Now is the time! Save and protect me! You and your family are the friends I seek. Do not abandon me in my hour of need!\"</p>\n<p>\"Great God!\" exclaimed the old man. \"Who are you?\"</p>\n<p>At that moment, the cottage door swung open, and Felix, Safie, and Agatha entered. Who can describe the horror and shock on their faces when they saw me? Agatha fainted, and Safie, unable to aid her friend, rushed out of the cottage. Felix lunged forward, and with incredible force, pulled me away from his father, to whose knees I clung. In a fit of rage, he threw me to the ground and struck me violently with a stick. I could have torn him apart like a lion rending its prey. But my heart sank within me like a heavy stone, and I held back. I saw him poised to strike again when, overcome with pain and anguish, I fled the cottage, escaping unnoticed back to my hovel.</p>",

Why, in that instant, did I not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed? I know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my feelings were those of rage and revenge. I could with pleasure have destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with their shrieks and misery. </p>\n<p> “When night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; and now, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my anguish in fearful howlings. I was like a wild beast that had broken the toils, destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging through the wood with a stag-like swiftness. Oh! What a miserable night I passed! The cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare trees waved their branches above me; now and then the sweet voice of a bird burst forth amidst the universal stillness. All, save I, were at rest or in enjoyment; I, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me, and finding myself unsympathised with, wished to tear up the trees, spread havoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed the ruin. </p>\n<p> “But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in the sick impotence of despair. There was none among the myriads of men that existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness towards my enemies? No: from that moment I declared everlasting war against the species, and more than all, against him who had formed me and sent me forth to this insupportable misery. </p>\n<p> “The sun rose; I heard the voices of men and knew that it was impossible to return to my retreat during that day. Accordingly I hid myself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours to reflection on my situation. </p>\n<p> “The pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some degree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the cottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my conclusions. I had certainly acted imprudently. It was apparent that my conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and I was a fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children. I ought to have familiarised the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees to have discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have been prepared for my approach. But I did not believe my errors to be irretrievable, and after much consideration I resolved to return to the cottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my party. </p>\n<p> “These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound sleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by peaceful dreams. The horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever acting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged Felix tearing me from his father’s feet. I awoke exhausted, and finding that it was already night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in search of food. </p>\n<p> “When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the well-known path that conducted to the cottage. All there was at peace. I crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the accustomed hour when the family arose. That hour passed, the sun mounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear. I trembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune. The inside of the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I cannot describe the agony of this suspense. </p>\n<p> “Presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they entered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did not understand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country, which differed from that of my protectors. Soon after, however, Felix approached with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that he had not quitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances. </p>\n<p> “‘Do you consider,’ said his companion to him, ‘that you will be obliged to pay three months’ rent and to lose the produce of your garden? I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and I beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your determination.’ </p>\n<p> “‘It is utterly useless,’ replied Felix; ‘we can never again inhabit your cottage. The life of my father is in the greatest danger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related. My wife and my sister will never recover from their horror. I entreat you not to reason with me any more. Take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this place.’ </p>\n<p> “Felix trembled violently as he said this. He and his companion entered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then departed. I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more. </p>\n<p> “I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of utter and stupid despair. My protectors had departed and had broken the only link that held me to the world. For the first time the feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to control them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I bent my mind towards injury and death. When I thought of my friends, of the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the exquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of tears somewhat soothed me. But again when I reflected that they had spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to injure anything human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects. As night advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage, and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden, I waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my operations. </p>\n<p> “As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection. I lighted the dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage, my eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon nearly touched. A part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my brand; it sank, and with a loud scream I fired the straw, and heath, and bushes, which I had collected. The wind fanned the fire, and the cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it and licked it with their forked and destroying tongues. </p>\n<p> “As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of the habitation, I quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods. </p>\n<p> “And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps? I resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated and despised, every country must be equally horrible. At length the thought of you crossed my mind. I learned from your papers that you were my father, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness than to him who had given me life? Among the lessons that Felix had bestowed upon Safie, geography had not been omitted; I had learned from these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth. You had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town, and towards this place I resolved to proceed. </p>\n<p> “But how was I to direct myself? I knew that I must travel in a southwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my only guide. I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass through, nor could I ask information from a single human being; but I did not despair. From you only could I hope for succour, although towards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred. Unfeeling, heartless creator! You had endowed me with perceptions and passions and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind. But on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I determined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from any other being that wore the human form. </p>\n<p> “My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense. It was late in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided. I travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a human being. Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless; rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface of the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter. Oh, earth! How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being! The mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall and bitterness. The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. Snow fell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not. A few incidents now and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I often wandered wide from my path. The agony of my feelings allowed me no respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could not extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived on the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth and the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings. </p>\n<p> “I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was secured by night from the view of man. One morning, however, finding that my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey after the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring, cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of the air. I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long appeared dead, revive within me. Half surprised by the novelty of these sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them, and forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy. Soft tears again bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with thankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me. </p>\n<p> “I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many of the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring. Here I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard the sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade of a cypress. I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running towards the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from someone in sport. She continued her course along the precipitous sides of the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the rapid stream. I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour, from the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore. She was senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic, who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled. On seeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms, hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood. I followed speedily, I hardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun, which he carried, at my body and fired. I sank to the ground, and my injurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood. </p>\n<p> “This was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human being from destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone. The feelings of kindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth. Inflamed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind. But the agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted. </p>\n<p> “For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to cure the wound which I had received. The ball had entered my shoulder, and I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any rate I had no means of extracting it. My sufferings were augmented also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their infliction. My daily vows rose for revenge—a deep and deadly revenge, such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had endured. </p>\n<p> “After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey. The labours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or gentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my desolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for the enjoyment of pleasure. </p>\n<p> “But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time I reached the environs of Geneva. </p>\n<p> “It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply to you. I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous mountains of Jura. </p>\n<p> “At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection, which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came running into the recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness of infancy. Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me that this little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have imbibed a horror of deformity. If, therefore, I could seize him and educate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in this peopled earth. </p>\n<p> “Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him towards me. As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before his eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I drew his hand forcibly from his face and said, ‘Child, what is the meaning of this? I do not intend to hurt you; listen to me.’ </p>\n<p> “He struggled violently. ‘Let me go,’ he cried; ‘monster! Ugly wretch! You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces. You are an ogre. Let me go, or I will tell my papa.’ </p>\n<p> “‘Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.’ </p>\n<p> “‘Hideous monster! Let me go. My papa is a syndic—he is M. Frankenstein—he will punish you. You dare not keep me.’ </p>\n<p> “‘Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy—to him towards whom I have sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.’ </p>\n<p> “The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried despair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a moment he lay dead at my feet. </p>\n<p> “I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish triumph; clapping my hands, I exclaimed, ‘I too can create desolation; my enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him, and a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.’ </p>\n<p> “As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his breast. I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman. In spite of my malignity, it softened and attracted me. For a few moments I gazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her lovely lips; but presently my rage returned; I remembered that I was for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in regarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one expressive of disgust and affright. </p>\n<p> “Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage? I only wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind and perish in the attempt to destroy them. </p>\n<p> “While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had committed the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty. A woman was sleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the loveliness of youth and health. Here, I thought, is one of those whose joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me. And then I bent over her and whispered, ‘Awake, fairest, thy lover is near—he who would give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my beloved, awake!’ </p>\n<p> “The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me. Should she indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer? Thus would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me. The thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within me—not I, but she, shall suffer; the murder I have committed because I am for ever robbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone. The crime had its source in her; be hers the punishment! Thanks to the lessons of Felix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to work mischief. I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of the folds of her dress. She moved again, and I fled. </p>\n<p> “For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place, sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and its miseries for ever. At length I wandered towards these mountains, and have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning passion which you alone can gratify. We may not part until you have promised to comply with my requisition. I am alone and miserable; man will not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself would not deny herself to me. My companion must be of the same species and have the same defects. This being you must create.” </p> </a></div>",
      "modern": "<p>Chapter 16</p>\n<p>“Cursed, cursed creator! Why did I have to live? Why, in that moment, didn’t I just extinguish the spark of life that you so recklessly gave me? I don’t know; despair hadn’t yet taken hold of me; I was filled with rage and a desire for revenge. I would have happily destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants, relishing their screams and suffering.</p>\n<p>“When night fell, I left my hiding place and wandered through the woods; no longer held back by the fear of being discovered, I expressed my anguish with terrifying howls. I was like a wild beast that had broken free from traps, tearing down anything that stood in my way and racing through the woods with the speed of a deer. Oh, what a miserable night I endured! The cold stars seemed to mock me, and the bare trees waved their branches overhead; occasionally, the sweet song of a bird broke through the universal stillness. Everyone else was at peace or enjoying themselves; I, like the ultimate fiend, carried a hell within me. Feeling completely alone, I wanted to uproot the trees and spread chaos and destruction around me, then sit back and revel in the ruin.</p>\n<p>“But this was a fleeting pleasure that couldn’t last; I became exhausted from my physical exertion and collapsed onto the damp grass, overwhelmed by despair. There was no one among the countless humans who would pity or help me; should I feel kindness toward my enemies? No: from that moment, I declared eternal war against humanity, and above all, against the one who had created me and sent me into this unbearable misery.</p>\n<p>“The sun rose; I heard the voices of men and knew it was impossible to return to my hiding place during the day. Instead, I hid in some thick underbrush, planning to spend the hours reflecting on my situation.</p>\n<p>“The pleasant sunlight and fresh air of day brought me some peace, and when I thought about what had happened at the cottage, I couldn’t help but believe I had been too hasty in my judgments. I had certainly acted foolishly. It was clear that my conversation had stirred the father’s interest on my behalf, and I was an idiot for exposing myself to the horror of his children. I should have gradually introduced myself to old De Lacey and revealed myself to the rest of his family when they were ready for my approach. But I didn’t think my mistakes were irreversible, and after much thought, I resolved to return to the cottage, seek out the old man, and convince him to support me.</p>\n<p>“These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon, I fell into a deep sleep; however, the fever in my blood prevented me from having peaceful dreams. The horrible scene of the previous day replayed endlessly in my mind: the women fleeing and the enraged Felix pulling me away from his father’s feet. I woke up exhausted, and realizing it was already night, I crept out from my hiding place in search of food.</p>\n<p>“After satisfying my hunger, I made my way toward the familiar path leading to the cottage. Everything was peaceful there. I crept into my hovel and waited silently for the usual hour when the family would rise. That hour passed, the sun climbed high in the sky, but the cottagers did not appear. I trembled violently, fearing something terrible had happened. The inside of the cottage was dark, and I heard no movement; I can’t describe the agony of this suspense.</p>\n<p>“Soon, two countrymen walked by, but paused near the cottage to engage in conversation, gesturing violently. I couldn’t understand them, as they spoke the local language, which was different from that of my protectors. Shortly after, however, Felix approached with another man. I was surprised, knowing he hadn’t left the cottage that morning, and I waited anxiously to learn from their conversation what was happening.</p>\n<p>“‘Do you realize,’ his companion said, ‘that you’ll have to pay three months’ rent and forfeit the produce of your garden? I don’t want to take unfair advantage of you, so I ask that you take some days to consider your decision.’</p>\n<p>“‘It’s utterly pointless,’ Felix replied; ‘we can never live in your cottage again. My father’s life is in great danger because of the terrible events I described. My wife and sister will never recover from their horror. I beg you not to discuss this further. Take possession of your property and let me leave this place.’</p>\n<p>“Felix trembled violently as he spoke. He and his companion entered the cottage, where they stayed for a few minutes before leaving. I never saw any of the De Lacey family again.</p>\n<p>“I spent the rest of the day in my hovel, consumed by utter and senseless despair. My protectors had left, severing the only connection I had to the world. For the first time, feelings of revenge and hatred filled my heart, and I didn’t try to suppress them. Instead, I let myself be swept away by those emotions, focusing my thoughts on injury and death. When I thought of my friends—the gentle voice of De Lacey, Agatha’s soft eyes, and the exquisite beauty of the Arabian—those thoughts faded, and tears began to soothe me. But again, when I remembered that they had rejected and abandoned me, anger flared back up, a fierce rage, and unable to harm anything human, I turned my fury on inanimate objects. As night fell, I gathered various flammable materials around the cottage and, after destroying every trace of cultivation in the garden, I waited impatiently for the moon to set before I began my work.</p>\n<p>“As the night wore on, a fierce wind rose from the woods, quickly clearing the clouds that had lingered in the sky; the gust tore through like a mighty avalanche, driving me to a kind of madness that shattered all bounds of reason and reflection. I lit a dry branch from a tree and danced with fury around the doomed cottage, my eyes fixed on the western horizon, where the moon hung low. A portion of its orb was eventually obscured, and I waved my torch; it sank, and with a loud scream, I set fire to the straw, heath, and bushes I had gathered. The wind fueled the flames, and soon the cottage was engulfed, the fire clinging to it and licking it with its destructive tongues.</p>\n<p>“Once I was sure that no help could save any part of the house, I left the scene and sought refuge in the woods.</p>\n<p>“And now, with the world stretched out before me, where was I to go? I decided to flee far from the site of my misfortunes; yet for me, hated and despised, every country was equally dreadful. Finally, the thought of you crossed my mind. I learned from your papers that you were my father, my creator; who better to turn to than the one who had given me life? Among the lessons Felix had taught Safie, geography was included; from these, I had learned the relative locations of different countries. You had mentioned Geneva as your hometown, and I resolved to head there.</p>\n<p>“But how was I to find my way? I knew I had to travel southwest to reach my destination, but the sun was my only guide. I didn’t know the names of the towns I would pass through, nor could I ask a single human being for directions; but I didn’t lose hope. From you alone could I expect help, even though I felt nothing but hatred toward you. Unfeeling, heartless creator! You gave me perceptions and passions and then cast me out as an object for the scorn and horror of mankind. But you were my only hope for compassion and justice, and from you, I resolved to seek the remedy I could not find from any other human being.</p>\n<p>“My travels were long, and the suffering I endured was intense. It was late autumn when I left the region where I had lived for so long. I traveled only at night, afraid of encountering the gaze of a human. Nature decayed around me, the sun lost its warmth; rain and snow fell incessantly; mighty rivers froze; the ground was hard, cold, and bare, and I found no shelter. Oh, earth! How often I cursed the cause of my existence! My gentle nature had vanished, and all that remained within me was bitterness and gall. The closer I got to your home, the more the spirit of revenge ignited in my heart. Snow fell, and the waters froze, but I pressed on. A few incidents guided me, and I had a map of the land; yet I often strayed far from my path. The agony of my feelings allowed me no respite; no event occurred from which my rage and misery couldn’t draw nourishment; but a particular incident happened when I reached the borders of Switzerland, just as the sun regained its warmth and the earth began to turn green again, which particularly deepened my bitterness and horror.</p>\n<p>“I usually rested during the day and traveled only at night, hidden from human eyes. One morning, though, finding my path led through a dense forest, I dared to continue my journey after the sun had risen; it was one of the first days of spring, and the beauty of the sunshine and the warmth of the air uplifted even me. Emotions of gentleness and pleasure, which had long seemed dead, began to revive within me. Half-surprised by the novelty of these feelings, I let myself be swept along by them, forgetting my solitude and deformity, daring to feel happiness. Soft tears filled my eyes, and I even raised my wet gaze in gratitude toward the blessed sun that brought me such joy.</p>\n<p>“I continued winding through the paths of the forest until I reached its edge, where a deep and swift river ran, its banks lined with trees just beginning to bud. Here I paused, uncertain of which path to take, when I heard voices that compelled me to hide under the shade of a cypress. I had scarcely concealed myself when a young girl came running toward where I was hidden, laughing as if she were fleeing from someone in play. She continued along the steep banks of the river when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the rushing water. I dashed from my hiding place and, with great effort against the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to the shore. She was unconscious, and I tried every means I could to revive her when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic, who was likely the person she had been fleeing from in jest. On seeing me, he rushed toward me and, snatching the girl from my arms, hurried into the deeper parts of the woods. I followed quickly, hardly knowing why; but when the man noticed me closing in, he aimed a gun he carried at me and fired. I collapsed to the ground, and my attacker fled into the woods with increased speed.</p>\n<p>“This was my reward for being kind! I had saved a human being from death, and as a reward, I now writhed in pain from a wound that shattered my flesh and bone. The feelings of kindness and gentleness I had just moments before felt were replaced by hellish rage and gnashing teeth. Consumed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance against all humanity. But the agony of my wound overcame me; my pulse slowed, and I fainted.</p>\n<p>“For weeks, I lived a miserable life in the woods, trying to heal the wound I had sustained. The bullet had entered my shoulder, and I didn’t know whether it was still lodged there or had passed through; in any case, I had no way to remove it. My suffering was intensified by the oppressive feeling of injustice and ingratitude from this injury. My daily vows rose for revenge—a deep and deadly revenge that would be the only thing to compensate for the outrages and anguish I had endured.</p>\n<p>“After several weeks, my wound healed, and I resumed my journey. The labors I endured were no longer alleviated by the bright sun or the gentle breezes of spring; all joy felt like a mockery that insulted my desolate state, making it painfully clear that I was not meant to enjoy pleasure.</p>\n<p>“But my struggles were nearing an end, and two months later, I found myself at the outskirts of Geneva.</p>\n<p>“It was evening when I arrived, and I took refuge in a hiding place among the fields surrounding it to contemplate how I should approach you. I was weighed down by fatigue and hunger, far too unhappy to appreciate the gentle evening breezes or the sight of the sun setting behind the majestic Jura mountains.</p>\n<p>“At that moment, a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of my thoughts, interrupted by the arrival of a beautiful child, who came running into the recess I had chosen, full of the playfulness of youth. Suddenly, as I gazed upon him, an idea struck me: this little creature was innocent and had lived too short a time to have developed a horror of deformity. If I could take him and raise him as my companion and friend, I would not feel so lonely in this populated world.</p>\n<p>“Driven by this impulse, I seized the boy as he passed and pulled him toward me. As soon as he saw my form, he put his hands over his eyes and screamed loudly; I forcefully pulled his hands away from his face and said, ‘Child, what does this mean? I don’t intend to harm you; please listen to me.’</p>\n<p>“He fought against me violently. ‘Let me go,’ he cried; ‘monster! Ugly wretch! You want to eat me and tear me apart. You’re an ogre. Let me go, or I’ll tell my papa.’</p>\n<p>“‘Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.’</p>\n<p>“‘Hideous monster! Let me go. My papa is a syndic—he is M. Frankenstein—he will punish you. You dare not keep me.’</p>\n<p>“‘Frankenstein! So you belong to my enemy—him whom I have sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.’</p>\n<p>“The child continued to struggle and showered me with insults that pierced my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in an instant, he lay dead at my feet.</p>\n<p>“I stared at my victim, and my heart swelled with triumph and hellish joy; clapping my hands, I exclaimed, ‘I too can create desolation; my enemy is not invincible; this death will bring despair to him, and a thousand other miseries will torment and destroy him.’</p>\n<p>“As I looked at the child, I noticed something glittering on his chest. I picked it up; it was a portrait of a most beautiful woman. Despite my malice, it softened and drew me in. For a moment, I gazed at her dark eyes, framed by long lashes, and her lovely lips; but soon, my rage returned; I remembered that I was forever deprived of the joys that such beautiful beings could offer, and that the woman whose likeness I admired would, upon seeing me, transform her expression of divine kindness into one of disgust and fear.</p>\n<p>“Can you blame me for being overcome with rage? I only wonder that at that moment, instead of expressing my feelings in cries of anguish, I didn’t rush into the human world and perish in my attempt to destroy them.</p>\n<p>“While I was consumed by these emotions, I left the scene of the murder and sought a more secluded hiding place, entering a barn that appeared empty. A woman was sleeping on some straw; she was young, not as beautiful as the woman in the portrait I held, but with an agreeable face, blooming with youth and health. Here, I thought, is one of those whose joyful smiles are shared with everyone but me. I leaned over her and whispered, ‘Awake, fairest, your lover is near—he who would give his life just to receive one look of affection from your eyes; my beloved, awaken!’</p>\n<p>“The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me. What if she woke up, saw me, cursed me, and denounced the murderer? Surely that would be her reaction if her eyes opened and she beheld me. The thought drove me to madness; I decided that she would suffer, not me. The murder I had committed was because I was forever robbed of everything she could give me, so she would pay the price. The crime originated with her; let her be the one punished! Thanks to Felix’s lessons and the bloody laws of humanity, I had learned to cause harm. I leaned over her and carefully placed the portrait in one of the folds of her dress. She stirred again, and I fled.</p>\n<p>“For several days, I haunted the site of these events, sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to leave the world and its miseries forever. Eventually, I wandered toward these mountains, roaming through their vast recesses, consumed by a burning desire that only you can fulfill. We cannot part until you promise to grant my request. I am alone and miserable; no one will associate with me; but one as deformed and monstrous as myself would not refuse me. This being you must create.”</p>",

But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his proposition. He continued, </p>\n<p> “You must create a female for me with whom I can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being. This you alone can do, and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to concede.” </p>\n<p> The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and as he said this I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within me. </p>\n<p> “I do refuse it,” I replied; “and no torture shall ever extort a consent from me. You may render me the most miserable of men, but you shall never make me base in my own eyes. Shall I create another like yourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world. Begone! I have answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent.” </p>\n<p> “You are in the wrong,” replied the fiend; “and instead of threatening, I am content to reason with you. I am malicious because I am miserable. Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind? You, my creator, would tear me to pieces and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I should pity man more than he pities me? You would not call it murder if you could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame, the work of your own hands. Shall I respect man when he condemns me? Let him live with me in the interchange of kindness, and instead of injury I would bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance. But that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our union. Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery. I will revenge my injuries; if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear, and chiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my creator, do I swear inextinguishable hatred. Have a care; I will work at your destruction, nor finish until I desolate your heart, so that you shall curse the hour of your birth.” </p>\n<p> A fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently he calmed himself and proceeded— </p>\n<p> “I intended to reason. This passion is detrimental to me, for you do not reflect that <i>you</i> are the cause of its excess. If any being felt emotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and a hundredfold; for that one creature’s sake I would make peace with the whole kind! But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised. What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of another sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it is all that I can receive, and it shall content me. It is true, we shall be monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more attached to one another. Our lives will not be happy, but they will be harmless and free from the misery I now feel. Oh! My creator, make me happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit! Let me see that I excite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my request!” </p>\n<p> I was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences of my consent, but I felt that there was some justice in his argument. His tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature of fine sensations, and did I not as his maker owe him all the portion of happiness that it was in my power to bestow? He saw my change of feeling and continued, </p>\n<p> “If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see us again; I will go to the vast wilds of South America. My food is not that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite; acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment. My companion will be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare. We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on man and will ripen our food. The picture I present to you is peaceful and human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the wantonness of power and cruelty. Pitiless as you have been towards me, I now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment and persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire.” </p>\n<p> “You propose,” replied I, “to fly from the habitations of man, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your only companions. How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man, persevere in this exile? You will return and again seek their kindness, and you will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed, and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction. This may not be; cease to argue the point, for I cannot consent.” </p>\n<p> “How inconstant are your feelings! But a moment ago you were moved by my representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints? I swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me, that with the companion you bestow, I will quit the neighbourhood of man and dwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places. My evil passions will have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy! My life will flow quietly away, and in my dying moments I shall not curse my maker.” </p>\n<p> His words had a strange effect upon me. I compassionated him and sometimes felt a wish to console him, but when I looked upon him, when I saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and my feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred. I tried to stifle these sensations; I thought that as I could not sympathise with him, I had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which was yet in my power to bestow. </p>\n<p> “You swear,” I said, “to be harmless; but have you not already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust you? May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by affording a wider scope for your revenge?” </p>\n<p> “How is this? I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer. If I have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion; the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant. My vices are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal. I shall feel the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of existence and events from which I am now excluded.” </p>\n<p> I paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various arguments which he had employed. I thought of the promise of virtues which he had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had manifested towards him. His power and threats were not omitted in my calculations; a creature who could exist in the ice-caves of the glaciers and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with. After a long pause of reflection I concluded that the justice due both to him and my fellow creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request. Turning to him, therefore, I said, </p>\n<p> “I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe for ever, and every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile.” </p>\n<p> “I swear,” he cried, “by the sun, and by the blue sky of heaven, and by the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my prayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again. Depart to your home and commence your labours; I shall watch their progress with unutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I shall appear.” </p>\n<p> Saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in my sentiments. I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than the flight of an eagle, and quickly lost among the undulations of the sea of ice. </p>\n<p> His tale had occupied the whole day, and the sun was upon the verge of the horizon when he departed. I knew that I ought to hasten my descent towards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my heart was heavy, and my steps slow. The labour of winding among the little paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced perplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrences of the day had produced. Night was far advanced when I came to the halfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain. The stars shone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines rose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the ground; it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange thoughts within me. I wept bitterly, and clasping my hands in agony, I exclaimed, “Oh! stars and clouds and winds, ye are all about to mock me; if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as nought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness.” </p>\n<p> These were wild and miserable thoughts, but I cannot describe to you how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how I listened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its way to consume me. </p>\n<p> Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no rest, but returned immediately to Geneva. Even in my own heart I could give no expression to my sensations—they weighed on me with a mountain’s weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them. Thus I returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to the family. My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm, but I answered no question, scarcely did I speak. I felt as if I were placed under a ban—as if I had no right to claim their sympathies—as if never more might I enjoy companionship with them. Yet even thus I loved them to adoration; and to save them, I resolved to dedicate myself to my most abhorred task. The prospect of such an occupation made every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream, and that thought only had to me the reality of life. </p> </a></div>",
      "modern": "<p>Chapter 17</p>\n<p>The creature finished speaking and fixed his gaze on me, waiting for a response. But I was confused, overwhelmed, and unable to organize my thoughts enough to grasp the full weight of his request. He continued, “You must create a female for me with whom I can share the understanding and companionship necessary for my existence. Only you can do this, and I demand it as a right that you cannot refuse.”</p>\n<p>The latter part of his story ignited the anger within me that had faded while he shared his peaceful life among the villagers. As he spoke, I could no longer contain the rage that surged inside me. “I refuse,” I replied. “No torture will ever force me to agree. You can make me the most miserable man alive, but you will never make me feel inferior in my own eyes. Am I to create another being like yourself, whose combined wickedness could devastate the world? Go away! I have answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent.”</p>\n<p>“You are mistaken,” the creature replied. “Instead of threatening, I prefer to reason with you. I am malicious because I am miserable. Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind? You, my creator, would tear me apart and revel in it; remember that and tell me why I should pity humanity more than they pity me? You wouldn’t call it murder if you threw me into one of those ice crevasses and destroyed the body you made. Should I respect humanity when they condemn me? If they lived with me in kindness, I would offer them every benefit with tears of gratitude for their acceptance. But that cannot be; human nature presents insurmountable barriers to our union. Yet I will not submit to being a slave. I will take revenge for my injuries; if I cannot inspire love, I will instill fear, especially towards you, my greatest enemy, because you are my creator. I swear unending hatred. Beware; I will work towards your destruction and will not stop until I have shattered your heart, so that you will curse the day you were born.”</p>\n<p>A fierce rage animated him as he spoke; his face twisted into contortions too horrific for any human to bear. But he soon calmed himself and continued, “I intended to reason with you. This passion is harmful to me, for you do not realize that you are the cause of it. If any being showed me kindness, I would return it a hundredfold; for that one creature, I would make peace with all humanity! But now I indulge in dreams of happiness that cannot be realized. What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I ask for a creature of the opposite sex, but as hideous as I am. The satisfaction is small, but it is all I can hope for, and it will be enough. It’s true, we will be monsters, cut off from the world; but because of that, we will be more attached to one another. Our lives may not be happy, but they will be harmless and free from the misery I currently endure. Oh! My creator, make me happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for just one kindness! Let me see that I can inspire sympathy in something that exists; do not deny my request!”</p>\n<p>I was moved. I shuddered at the potential consequences of agreeing, but I felt there was some justice in his argument. His story and the emotions he expressed revealed him to be a creature capable of deep feelings, and as his creator, shouldn’t I owe him some measure of happiness that I could give? He saw my change of heart and pressed on, “If you agree, neither you nor any other human will ever see us again; I will go to the vast wilds of South America. I do not eat like a human; I do not kill lambs or kids to satisfy my hunger; acorns and berries provide me with enough sustenance. My companion will be like me and will be satisfied with the same food. We will make our bed from dried leaves; the sun will shine on us like it does on mankind and ripen our food. The picture I offer is peaceful and human, and you must feel that denying it would be an act of cruelty and power. Despite your past ruthlessness towards me, I now see compassion in your eyes; let me take this opportunity to persuade you to grant my heartfelt wish.”</p>\n<p>“You suggest,” I replied, “that you flee from human civilization to live in wild places where only beasts will be your companions. How can you, who crave love and companionship from humans, endure such isolation? You will return and seek their kindness again, and you will be met with hatred; your evil instincts will resurface, and you will have a companion to help you destroy. This cannot happen; stop arguing, for I cannot agree.”</p>\n<p>“How fickle your feelings are! Just a moment ago, you were moved by my story; why have you hardened yourself to my plight again? I swear to you, by the land I inhabit and by you who created me, that with the companion you give me, I will leave the presence of humans and live wherever fate takes me, even in the most savage places. My evil urges will vanish because I will find sympathy! My life will flow quietly away, and in my final moments, I will not curse my creator.”</p>\n<p>His words had a strange effect on me. I felt compassion for him and sometimes wished to comfort him, but when I looked at him, seeing the filthy mass that moved and spoke, my heart recoiled, and my feelings turned to horror and hatred. I tried to suppress these emotions; I thought that since I could not empathize with him, I had no right to deny him the small chance of happiness I could offer.</p>\n<p>“You swear,” I said, “to be harmless; but haven’t you already shown enough malice to make me distrust you? Could this not be a trick that would expand your triumph by giving you more room for revenge?”</p>\n<p>“How can you say that? I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer. If I have no connections and no affections, hatred and vice will be my fate; the love of another will extinguish my crimes, and I will become an unknown being. My vices are the result of a forced solitude that I detest, and my virtues will arise when I live alongside an equal. I will feel the affections of a sensitive being and become part of the chain of existence and events from which I am now excluded.”</p>\n<p>I paused for some time to reflect on everything he had said and the various arguments he had made. I thought of the promise of virtues he had displayed at the start of his existence and how all kindness had been blighted by the disgust and scorn shown by those who should have protected him. I also considered his power and threats; a creature who could survive in glacier ice caves and hide from pursuit among steep cliffs was a being with abilities it would be foolish to confront. After a long pause of contemplation, I concluded that the justice owed to both him and to humanity required me to comply with his request. Turning to him, I said, “I agree to your demand, on your solemn oath to leave Europe forever, and any other human-inhabited place, as soon as I deliver to you a female who will accompany you in your exile.”</p>\n<p>“I swear,” he cried, “by the sun, by the blue sky of heaven, and by the fire of love that burns in my heart, that if you grant my wish, you will never see me again while I live. Go home and begin your work; I will watch your progress with unending anxiety. Do not fear; when you are ready, I will appear.”</p>\n<p>With that, he abruptly left me, perhaps fearing any change in my feelings. I saw him descend the mountain faster than an eagle flies, quickly disappearing among the rolling ice. His story had taken the entire day, and the sun was just setting when he departed. I knew I should hurry down to the valley, as darkness would soon surround me; but my heart was heavy, and my steps slow. The effort of navigating the winding paths of the mountain and firmly placing my feet as I moved distracted me, consumed as I was by the emotions stirred by the day’s events.</p>\n<p>Night was far advanced when I reached the halfway resting place and sat beside the fountain. The stars shone intermittently as clouds passed overhead; dark pines loomed before me, and now and then a broken tree lay on the ground. It was a scene of remarkable solemnity and stirred strange thoughts within me. I wept bitterly, and clasping my hands in agony, I exclaimed, “Oh! Stars and clouds and winds, you are all about to mock me; if you truly pity me, crush my feelings and memory; let me become nothing; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness.”</p>\n<p>These were wild and miserable thoughts, but I cannot describe how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how I listened to every gust of wind as if it were a dull, ugly sirocco on its way to consume me. Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no rest but returned immediately to Geneva. Even in my own heart, I could not express my feelings—they pressed down on me with the weight of a mountain, overwhelming me with their intensity.</p>\n<p>Thus, I returned home, and entering the house, I presented myself to the family. My haggard and wild appearance sparked intense alarm, but I answered no questions and barely spoke. I felt as if I were under a curse—as if I had no right to seek their sympathy—as if I could never again enjoy their company. Yet even so, I loved them dearly; and to save them, I resolved to commit myself to the task I most despised. The thought of such an undertaking made every other aspect of existence fade before me like a dream, and that thought alone became my reality.</p>",

      "original": "<div class=\"chapter\" id=\"pgepubid00024\"> <h2><a id=\"chap18\">Chapter 18</a></h2><a id=\"chap18\"> <p> Day after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and I could not collect the courage to recommence my work. I feared the vengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task which was enjoined me. I found that I could not compose a female without again devoting several months to profound study and laborious disquisition. I had heard of some discoveries having been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was material to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my father’s consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to me. A change indeed had taken place in me; my health, which had hitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably. My father saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy, which every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring blackness overcast the approaching sunshine. At these moments I took refuge in the most perfect solitude. I passed whole days on the lake alone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the rippling of the waves, silent and listless. But the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure, and on my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile and a more cheerful heart. </p>\n<p> It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father, calling me aside, thus addressed me, </p>\n<p> “I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself. And yet you are still unhappy and still avoid our society. For some time I was lost in conjecture as to the cause of this, but yesterday an idea struck me, and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it. Reserve on such a point would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all.” </p>\n<p> I trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continued— </p>\n<p> “I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your marriage with our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the stay of my declining years. You were attached to each other from your earliest infancy; you studied together, and appeared, in dispositions and tastes, entirely suited to one another. But so blind is the experience of man that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have entirely destroyed it. You, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any wish that she might become your wife. Nay, you may have met with another whom you may love; and considering yourself as bound in honour to Elizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear to feel.” </p>\n<p> “My dear father, reassure yourself. I love my cousin tenderly and sincerely. I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my warmest admiration and affection. My future hopes and prospects are entirely bound up in the expectation of our union.” </p>\n<p> “The expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear Victor, gives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced. If you feel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast a gloom over us. But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so strong a hold of your mind that I wish to dissipate. Tell me, therefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the marriage. We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities. You are younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent fortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future plans of honour and utility that you may have formed. Do not suppose, however, that I wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on your part would cause me any serious uneasiness. Interpret my words with candour and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and sincerity.” </p>\n<p> I listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable of offering any reply. I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion. Alas! To me the idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror and dismay. I was bound by a solemn promise which I had not yet fulfilled and dared not break, or if I did, what manifold miseries might not impend over me and my devoted family! Could I enter into a festival with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the ground? I must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with his mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from which I expected peace. </p>\n<p> I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to England or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers of that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable use to me in my present undertaking. The latter method of obtaining the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, I had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my loathsome task in my father’s house while in habits of familiar intercourse with those I loved. I knew that a thousand fearful accidents might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale to thrill all connected with me with horror. I was aware also that I should often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my unearthly occupation. I must absent myself from all I loved while thus employed. Once commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might be restored to my family in peace and happiness. My promise fulfilled, the monster would depart for ever. Or (so my fond fancy imaged) some accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my slavery for ever. </p>\n<p> These feelings dictated my answer to my father. I expressed a wish to visit England, but concealing the true reasons of this request, I clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while I urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to comply. After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that resembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find that I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey, and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my return, have restored me entirely to myself. </p>\n<p> The duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or at most a year, was the period contemplated. One paternal kind precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion. Without previously communicating with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth, arranged that Clerval should join me at Strasburgh. This interfered with the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be an impediment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved many hours of lonely, maddening reflection. Nay, Henry might stand between me and the intrusion of my foe. If I were alone, would he not at times force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to contemplate its progress? </p>\n<p> To England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union with Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return. My father’s age rendered him extremely averse to delay. For myself, there was one reward I promised myself from my detested toils—one consolation for my unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when, enfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth and forget the past in my union with her. </p>\n<p> I now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me which filled me with fear and agitation. During my absence I should leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my departure. But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go, and would he not accompany me to England? This imagination was dreadful in itself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends. I was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of this might happen. But through the whole period during which I was the slave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of the moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his machinations. </p>\n<p> It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native country. My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth therefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of my suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief. It had been her care which provided me a companion in Clerval—and yet a man is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman’s sedulous attention. She longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent farewell. </p>\n<p> I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly knowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around. I remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on it, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with me. Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful and majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed and unobserving. I could only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy me whilst they endured. </p>\n<p> After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed many leagues, I arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two days for Clerval. He came. Alas, how great was the contrast between us! He was alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the setting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new day. He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and the appearances of the sky. “This is what it is to live,” he cried; “now I enjoy existence! But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are you desponding and sorrowful!” In truth, I was occupied by gloomy thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden sunrise reflected in the Rhine. And you, my friend, would be far more amused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an eye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections. I, a miserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to enjoyment. </p>\n<p> We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasburgh to Rotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London. During this voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns. We stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from Strasburgh, arrived at Mainz. The course of the Rhine below Mainz becomes much more picturesque. The river descends rapidly and winds between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms. We saw many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by black woods, high and inaccessible. This part of the Rhine, indeed, presents a singularly variegated landscape. In one spot you view rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with the dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory, flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river and populous towns occupy the scene. </p>\n<p> We travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers as we glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at the bottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And if these were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as if he had been transported to Fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by man. “I have seen,” he said, “the most beautiful scenes of my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay appearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be on the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain, where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the nightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud; but this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders. The mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a charm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled. Look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the island, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now that group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village half hid in the recess of the mountain. Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of our own country.” </p>\n<p> Clerval! Beloved friend! Even now it delights me to record your words and to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving. He was a being formed in the “very poetry of nature.” His wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart. His soul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that devoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look for only in the imagination. But even human sympathies were not sufficient to satisfy his eager mind. The scenery of external nature, which others regard only with admiration, he loved with ardour:— </p> <p class=\"poem\"> ——The sounding cataract<br> Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock,<br> The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,<br> Their colours and their forms, were then to him<br> An appetite; a feeling, and a love,<br> That had no need of a remoter charm,<br> By thought supplied, or any interest<br> Unborrow’d from the eye.<br> <br> [Wordsworth’s “Tintern Abbey”.] </p>\n<p> And where does he now exist? Is this gentle and lovely being lost for ever? Has this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful and magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the life of its creator;—has this mind perished? Does it now only exist in my memory? No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and beaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and consoles your unhappy friend. </p>\n<p> Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight tribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart, overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates. I will proceed with my tale. </p>\n<p> Beyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved to post the remainder of our way, for the wind was contrary and the stream of the river was too gentle to aid us. </p>\n<p> Our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but we arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England. It was on a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first saw the white cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames presented a new scene; they were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by the remembrance of some story. We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the Spanish Armada, Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich—places which I had heard of even in my country. </p>\n<p> At length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul’s towering above all, and the Tower famed in English history. </p> </a></div>",
      "modern": "<p>CHAPTER 18</p>\n<p>Day after day, week after week, passed by since my return to Geneva, and I couldn't muster the courage to start my work again. I feared the wrath of the frustrated creature, but I also couldn't shake my aversion to the task I had been assigned. I realized that I couldn't create a female without dedicating several months to deep study and painstaking effort. I had heard of some discoveries made by an English philosopher that were crucial to my success, and I occasionally thought about asking my father for permission to visit England for this purpose. However, I found excuses to delay and hesitated to take the first step in an endeavor that was beginning to feel less urgent to me.</p>\n<p>Indeed, a change had occurred within me; my health, which had been deteriorating, was now significantly improved, and my spirits, when not weighed down by the memory of my unhappy promise, lifted accordingly. My father noticed this change with pleasure and began to think of ways to eliminate the remnants of my melancholy, which would occasionally resurface, casting a dark shadow over the bright days. In those moments, I sought refuge in complete solitude. I spent entire days alone on the lake in a small boat, watching the clouds and listening to the gentle lapping of the waves, silent and aimless. Yet, the fresh air and bright sunlight often helped me regain some sense of calm, and upon my return, I greeted my friends with a more genuine smile and a lighter heart.</p>\n<p>It was after one of these solitary outings that my father called me aside and said, “I’m glad to see, my dear son, that you have returned to your former interests and seem to be finding yourself again. Yet you still seem unhappy and avoid our company. For a while, I puzzled over the cause of this, but yesterday an idea struck me, and if I am correct, I urge you to admit it. Keeping silent on such a matter would not only be pointless, but it would also bring immense suffering to us all.”</p>\n<p>I trembled at his words, and my father continued, “I must confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your marriage with our dear Elizabeth as the foundation of our family’s happiness and the support of my old age. You have been attached to each other since childhood; you studied together and seemed perfectly suited to one another in character and taste. But how blind is human experience! What I thought would help my plans may have completely ruined them. Perhaps you see her as your sister and have no desire for her to become your wife. You may have fallen in love with someone else, and feeling bound by honor to Elizabeth could cause the deep sorrow you seem to carry.”</p>\n<p>“My dear father, please don’t worry. I love my cousin deeply and sincerely. I have never seen any woman who inspires in me the admiration and affection that Elizabeth does. My hopes and future are entirely linked to the expectation of our union.”</p>\n<p>“Your words bring me more joy than I have felt in a long time, my dear Victor. If you feel this way, we will surely be happy, no matter how current events might darken our situation. But it’s this darkness that seems to have such a strong hold on your mind that I wish to dispel. So tell me, do you object to an immediate wedding? We have faced misfortune, and recent events have disrupted the peaceful routine appropriate for my age and frailty. You are younger; still, I don’t think that an early marriage would interfere with any future plans of honor and usefulness you might have. But do not think I want to dictate your happiness or that a delay would cause me serious concern. Please interpret my words honestly and respond to me with trust and sincerity.”</p>\n<p>I listened to my father in silence and found myself unable to respond for a while. A whirlwind of thoughts raced through my mind as I tried to reach a conclusion. Alas! The idea of an immediate union with Elizabeth filled me with dread and despair. I was bound by a solemn promise I had yet to fulfill, and I feared breaking it. What endless miseries could await me and my devoted family if I did? Could I celebrate a wedding with this heavy burden still hanging over me, dragging me down? I had to fulfill my promise and let the creature depart with his mate before I could allow myself to enjoy the bliss of a union that I hoped would bring me peace.</p>\n<p>I also remembered that I needed to either travel to England or engage in a long correspondence with the philosophers there whose knowledge and discoveries were essential for my current project. The latter option would be slow and unsatisfactory; besides, I couldn’t bear the thought of working on my repulsive task in my father’s house while surrounded by those I loved. I knew that countless dreadful accidents could occur, and even the slightest of them could reveal a story that would terrify everyone connected to me. I was also aware that I would often lose control and be unable to hide the torment I would feel while engaged in my unnatural work. I had to distance myself from all I loved while doing this. Once I started, it would quickly be done, and I could return to my family in peace and happiness. Once my promise was fulfilled, the creature would leave forever. Or, as my hopeful imagination pictured, some accident might happen to destroy him and end my torment permanently.</p>\n<p>These feelings shaped my response to my father. I expressed a desire to visit England, concealing my true reasons and disguising my request in a way that would raise no suspicion. I urged my intention with such earnestness that my father readily agreed. After a long period of overwhelming sadness that felt like madness, he was relieved to see that I could find joy in the idea of such a journey, and he hoped that a change of scenery and new activities would restore me completely before my return. The duration of my absence was left to my discretion; I contemplated a few months, or at most a year. One precaution my father took was to ensure that I would have a companion. Without discussing it with me, he had arranged, along with Elizabeth, for Clerval to join me in Strasburgh. This interfered with the solitude I desired for my work, but at the start of my journey, having my friend with me would pose no obstacle, and I genuinely welcomed the company to avoid hours of lonely, maddening reflection. Besides, Henry could help shield me from the intrusion of my foe. If I were alone, wouldn’t he force his hated presence upon me to remind me of my task or to contemplate its progress?</p>\n<p>So to England I was bound, and it was understood that my marriage with Elizabeth would take place immediately upon my return. My father’s age made him very averse to any delay. For myself, there was one reward I promised myself from my hated labors—one consolation for my unparalleled suffering: the prospect of that day when, freed from my miserable bondage, I could claim Elizabeth and forget the past in her embrace.</p>\n<p>I began making arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me, filling me with fear and anxiety. During my absence, I would leave my friends unaware of the existence of their enemy and vulnerable to his attacks, especially if he were angered by my departure. Yet he had promised to follow me wherever I went. Would he not accompany me to England? This thought was terrifying, yet comforting in that it implied my friends’ safety. I was tormented by the possibility that the opposite could occur. But throughout the time I had been a slave to my creature, I allowed myself to be driven by the moment’s impulses, and my current feelings strongly suggested that the fiend would follow me while sparing my family from his schemes.</p>\n<p>It was in late September that I left my home country again. The journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth had agreed, but she was anxious about my suffering away from her, facing misery and grief. She had taken care to provide me with a companion in Clerval; yet a man often overlooks the many small details that call forth a woman’s attentive nature. She longed to urge me to hurry back, and a thousand conflicting emotions left her silent as she tearfully bid me farewell. I climbed into the carriage that would take me away, hardly aware of where I was going or what was happening around me. All I could think of, with bitter anguish, was to ensure that my chemical instruments were packed to accompany me.</p>\n<p>Filled with gloomy thoughts, I passed through many beautiful and majestic landscapes, but my eyes were fixed and unseeing. I could only think of the destination of my travels and the work that awaited me. After several days spent in aimless wandering, during which I covered many miles, I arrived in Strasburgh, where I waited two days for Clerval. When he arrived, the contrast between us was stark. He was thrilled by every new scene, joyful at the beauty of the setting sun, and even happier when he saw it rise to start a new day. He pointed out the shifting colors of the landscape and the changing sky. “This is what it means to live!” he exclaimed. “Now I truly enjoy existence! But you, my dear Frankenstein, why are you so despondent and sorrowful?”</p>\n<p>In truth, I was consumed by dark thoughts and didn’t notice the evening star or the golden sunrise reflecting on the Rhine. You, my friend, would find Clerval’s journal far more amusing, as he observed the scenery with a sense of feeling and delight, than listening to my reflections. I, a miserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut off every avenue to enjoyment.</p>\n<p>We had agreed to travel down the Rhine by boat from Strasburgh to Rotterdam, from where we would take a ship to London. During this voyage, we passed many willow-lined islands and saw several beautiful towns. We spent a day in Mannheim, and on the fifth day after leaving Strasburgh, we arrived at Mainz. Below Mainz, the Rhine becomes much more picturesque. The river flows rapidly and winds between hills, which, while not very high, are steep and beautifully shaped. We saw many ruined castles perched on the edges of cliffs, surrounded by dark, inaccessible woods. This section of the Rhine presents a wonderfully varied landscape. In one spot, you see rugged hills and ruined castles overlooking deep chasms, with the dark Rhine rushing below; and at a sudden turn, you find lush vineyards with green, sloping banks and a winding river, dotted with bustling towns.</p>\n<p>We traveled during the grape harvest and heard the songs of the laborers as we glided down the stream. Even I, though burdened with dark thoughts and my spirits continually agitated, found some pleasure in it. I lay at the bottom of the boat, gazing at the clear blue sky, and for the first time in a long while, I felt a sense of peace wash over me. If I felt this way, who could describe the joy Henry experienced? He felt as if he had been transported to a fairy tale and enjoyed a happiness rarely felt by anyone.</p>\n<p>“I have seen,” he said, “the most beautiful places in my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the snowy mountains almost drop straight into the water, casting dark and impenetrable shadows that would seem gloomy were it not for the lush islands that brighten the view. I’ve witnessed this lake stirred by a storm, where the wind whips up whirlpools of water and gives you a taste of what a waterspout must be like on the ocean; and the waves crash furiously against the mountains, where a priest and his lover were buried by an avalanche, and their dying cries are said to be heard in the pauses of the nightly wind. I’ve seen the mountains of La Valais and the Pays de Vaud, but this country, Victor, captivates me more than all those wonders. The mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a charm in the banks of this divine river that I have never seen matched. Look at that castle perched on the cliff over there; and that one on the island, almost hidden among the lovely trees; and look at that group of laborers coming from the vineyards; and that village half-hidden in the mountain’s recesses. Surely, the spirit that inhabits and protects this place is more in harmony with humanity than those who dwell on glaciers or retreat to the inaccessible peaks of our own mountains.”</p>\n<p>Clerval! Beloved friend! Even now it brings me joy to record your words and to reflect on the praise you so richly deserve. He was a being made from the “very poetry of nature.” His wild and enthusiastic imagination was tempered by the sensitivity of his heart. His soul overflowed with passionate affections, and his friendship was of a devoted and remarkable nature that the worldly-minded tell us to expect only in fantasy. Yet even human connections were not enough to satisfy his eager spirit. He loved the beauty of nature, which others admire only superficially, with a deep passion:—</p>\n<p>The roaring waterfall  \nHaunted him like a passion: the tall rock,  \nThe mountain, and the deep, dark wood,  \nTheir colors and forms were to him  \nAn appetite; a feeling, and a love,  \nThat needed no further charm,  \nSupplied by thought, or any interest  \nNot drawn from the eye.</p>\n<p>And where is he now? Is this gentle and lovely being lost forever? Has this mind, so filled with ideas, and imaginative visions that created a world whose existence depended on its creator’s life—has this mind vanished? Does it now only linger in my memory? No, it is not so; your divinely crafted form, radiant with beauty, may have decayed, but your spirit still visits and comforts your unhappy friend. Forgive this outpouring of sorrow; these inadequate words are a meager tribute to Henry’s extraordinary worth, yet they ease my heart, which is overwhelmed with the anguish his memory brings.</p>\n<p>I will continue with my tale. After leaving Cologne, we descended to the plains of Holland and decided to take a carriage for the rest of the journey, as the wind was against us and the river’s current was too gentle to help us. The scenery lost its charm here, but we arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, from where we sailed to England. It was a clear morning in late December when I first saw the white cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames presented a new scene; they were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by a story. We saw Tilbury Fort and recalled the Spanish Armada, Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich—places I had heard about even in my homeland. Finally, we caught sight of the numerous spires of London, with St. Paul’s towering above all and the Tower, famous in English history.</p>",

      "original": "<div class=\"chapter\" id=\"pgepubid00025\"> <h2><a id=\"chap19\">Chapter 19</a></h2><a id=\"chap19\"> <p> London was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several months in this wonderful and celebrated city. Clerval desired the intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this time, but this was with me a secondary object; I was principally occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the completion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of introduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the most distinguished natural philosophers. </p>\n<p> If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness, it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. But a blight had come over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest was so terribly profound. Company was irksome to me; when alone, I could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of Henry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace. But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to my heart. I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my fellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and Justine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled my soul with anguish. </p>\n<p> But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive and anxious to gain experience and instruction. The difference of manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of instruction and amusement. He was also pursuing an object he had long had in view. His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had in his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had taken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of European colonization and trade. In Britain only could he further the execution of his plan. He was for ever busy, and the only check to his enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind. I tried to conceal this as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by any care or bitter recollection. I often refused to accompany him, alleging another engagement, that I might remain alone. I now also began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling on the head. Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to quiver, and my heart to palpitate. </p>\n<p> After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in Scotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva. He mentioned the beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth, where he resided. Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and I, although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams and all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places. </p>\n<p> We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now February. We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the north at the expiration of another month. In this expedition we did not intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford, Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of this tour about the end of July. I packed up my chemical instruments and the materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland. </p>\n<p> We quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days at Windsor, rambling in its beautiful forest. This was a new scene to us mountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of stately deer were all novelties to us. </p>\n<p> From thence we proceeded to Oxford. As we entered this city, our minds were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted there more than a century and a half before. It was here that Charles I. had collected his forces. This city had remained faithful to him, after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of Parliament and liberty. The memory of that unfortunate king and his companions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they might be supposed to have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps. If these feelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration. The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters, which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and domes, embosomed among aged trees. </p>\n<p> I enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of the past and the anticipation of the future. I was formed for peaceful happiness. During my youthful days discontent never visited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by <i>ennui</i>, the sight of what is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate elasticity to my spirits. But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has entered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what I shall soon cease to be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity, pitiable to others and intolerable to myself. </p>\n<p> We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most animating epoch of English history. Our little voyages of discovery were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves. We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the field on which that patriot fell. For a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments and the remembrancers. For an instant I dared to shake off my chains and look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my miserable self. </p>\n<p> We left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next place of rest. The country in the neighbourhood of this village resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but everything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of distant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my native country. We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets of natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix. The latter name made me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit Matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated. </p>\n<p> From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in Cumberland and Westmorland. I could now almost fancy myself among the Swiss mountains. The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me. Here also we made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into happiness. The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his inferiors. “I could pass my life here,” said he to me; “and among these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine.” </p>\n<p> But he found that a traveller’s life is one that includes much pain amidst its enjoyments. His feelings are for ever on the stretch; and when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties. </p>\n<p> We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them to travel on. For my own part I was not sorry. I had now neglected my promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the dæmon’s disappointment. He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance on my relatives. This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace. I waited for my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to read and ascertain my fate. Sometimes I thought that the fiend followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion. When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment, but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of his destroyer. I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the consciousness of which haunted me. I was guiltless, but I had indeed drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime. </p>\n<p> I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might have interested the most unfortunate being. Clerval did not like it so well as Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him. But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic castle and its environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur’s Seat, St. Bernard’s Well, and the Pentland Hills, compensated him for the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. But I was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey. </p>\n<p> We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew’s, and along the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us. But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland alone. “Do you,” said I, “enjoy yourself, and let this be our rendezvous. I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with my motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short time; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more congenial to your own temper.” </p>\n<p> Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to remonstrate. He entreated me to write often. “I had rather be with you,” he said, “in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch people, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear friend, to return, that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in your absence.” </p>\n<p> Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of Scotland and finish my work in solitude. I did not doubt but that the monster followed me and would discover himself to me when I should have finished, that he might receive his companion. </p>\n<p> With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of the remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours. It was a place fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were continually beaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren, scarcely affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave tokens of their miserable fare. Vegetables and bread, when they indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from the mainland, which was about five miles distant. </p>\n<p> On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of these was vacant when I arrived. This I hired. It contained but two rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable penury. The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the door was off its hinges. I ordered it to be repaired, bought some furniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been benumbed by want and squalid poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed at and unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations of men. </p>\n<p> In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening, when the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea to listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet. It was a monotonous yet ever-changing scene. I thought of Switzerland; it was far different from this desolate and appalling landscape. Its hills are covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the plains. Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean. </p>\n<p> In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but as I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and irksome to me. Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and night in order to complete my work. It was, indeed, a filthy process in which I was engaged. During my first experiment, a kind of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes were shut to the horror of my proceedings. But now I went to it in cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands. </p>\n<p> Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from the actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I grew restless and nervous. Every moment I feared to meet my persecutor. Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing to raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much dreaded to behold. I feared to wander from the sight of my fellow creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion. </p>\n<p> In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably advanced. I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager hope, which I dared not trust myself to question but which was intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken in my bosom. </p> </a></div>",
      "modern": "<p>Chapter 19</p>\n<p>London was our current destination, and we decided to stay for several months in this remarkable and renowned city. Clerval was eager to engage with the brilliant minds and talented individuals of the time, but for me, that was a secondary concern. My main focus was on gathering the information I needed to fulfill my promise, so I quickly made use of the letters of introduction I had brought, which were addressed to the most prominent natural philosophers. If this journey had occurred during my days of study and happiness, it would have brought me immense joy. Instead, a shadow had fallen over my life, and I only sought out these people for the information they could provide on a topic that haunted me deeply. Being around others felt burdensome; when I was alone, I could immerse myself in the beauty of the world around me. Henry's voice offered some comfort, allowing me to momentarily escape into a fleeting peace. But the cheerful, busy faces of others only reminded me of my despair. I felt an unbridgeable chasm between myself and my fellow humans, a chasm sealed with the blood of William and Justine. Reflecting on the events tied to those names filled me with torment. Yet, in Clerval, I saw a reflection of my former self; he was curious and eager to learn and grow. The differences he noticed in people were an endless source of knowledge and enjoyment for him. He was also pursuing a long-held dream of visiting India, believing that his understanding of its languages and cultures could significantly assist European colonization and trade. Only in Britain could he further his plans. He was constantly busy, and the only thing that dampened his enjoyment was my sorrowful and downcast demeanor. I tried to hide my feelings as much as possible to avoid robbing him of the joys that naturally accompany someone embarking on a new chapter in life, free from cares or painful memories. I often declined his invitations to join him, claiming other commitments, just so I could be alone.</p>\n<p>I also began gathering the materials I needed for my new creation, which felt like a torture of slow, relentless drops of water falling on my head. Each thought devoted to it brought me intense anguish, and even mentioning it caused my lips to tremble and my heart to race. After spending several months in London, we received a letter from someone in Scotland who had previously visited us in Geneva. He spoke of the beauty of his homeland and asked if we wouldn't be tempted to extend our journey northward to Perth, where he lived. Clerval was eager to accept this invitation, and though I loathed socializing, I longed to see mountains and streams again, to witness the incredible landscapes that Nature adorns her chosen places with. We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and now it was February. So we decided to start our journey northward in about a month.</p>\n<p>For this trip, we planned not to take the main road to Edinburgh, but instead to visit Windsor, Oxford, Matlock, and the lakes of Cumberland, aiming to complete our tour by the end of July. I packed my chemical instruments and the materials I had gathered, determined to finish my work in some secluded spot in the northern highlands of Scotland. We left London on March 27 and spent a few days in Windsor, wandering through its beautiful forest. This was a new experience for us mountaineers; the majestic oaks, the abundance of game, and the herds of regal deer were all novelties. From there, we continued on to Oxford. As we entered the city, memories flooded our minds of events that had taken place there over a century and a half ago. It was here that Charles I had gathered his forces. This city had remained loyal to him when the rest of the nation had abandoned his cause to support Parliament and liberty. The memory of that unfortunate king and his companions—the amiable Falkland, the arrogant Goring, his queen, and his son—added a unique significance to every part of the city they might have inhabited. The spirit of those earlier days lingered here, and we took pleasure in tracing its path. Even if these sentiments were merely imaginary, the city's beauty alone was enough to capture our admiration. The colleges were ancient and picturesque, the streets almost magnificent, and the lovely Isis, flowing through lush meadows, spread out into a calm expanse of water that reflected a stunning array of towers, spires, and domes nestled among ancient trees. I enjoyed the scene, but my pleasure was tainted by memories of the past and fears about the future. I was meant for peaceful happiness. In my youth, discontent never visited my mind, and even if I felt bored, the beauty of nature or the brilliance of human creations could always lift my spirits. But now I felt like a withered tree; a bolt had struck my soul, and I sensed that I would live on to become a pitiful spectacle of broken humanity, both pitiful to others and intolerable to myself.</p>\n<p>We spent quite a while in Oxford, exploring its surroundings and trying to identify every spot linked to the most exciting period of English history. Our little adventures were often extended by the continuous attractions we encountered. We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the field where that patriot fell. For a moment, my spirit was lifted from its misery to contemplate the divine ideals of liberty and self-sacrifice that these sites represented. For an instant, I dared to shake off my chains and look around with a free, lofty spirit, but the iron had embedded itself in my flesh, and I sank back down, trembling and hopeless, into my wretched self. We left Oxford with a sense of loss and traveled to Matlock, our next stop. The countryside around this village resembled the scenery of Switzerland, but it was on a smaller scale, and the green hills lacked the distant white Alps that always accompany the pine-covered mountains of my homeland. We explored the marvelous cave and the small natural history collections, where curiosities were arranged much like those at Servox and Chamounix. The mention of that last name made me shudder when Henry spoke it, and I quickly wanted to leave Matlock, forever linked to that dreadful scene.</p>\n<p>From Derby, still heading north, we spent two months in Cumberland and Westmorland. I could almost imagine myself among the Swiss mountains again. The small patches of snow lingering on the northern slopes, the lakes, and the rushing rocky streams were all familiar and cherished sights to me. Here, we also made a few acquaintances who almost managed to pull me into happiness. Clerval's delight was even greater than mine; his mind expanded in the company of talented individuals, and he discovered in himself greater capabilities and resources than he had imagined while mingling with those of lesser stature. “I could spend my life here,” he told me. “Among these mountains, I would hardly miss Switzerland and the Rhine.” But he realized that a traveler's life comes with its share of pain amidst the pleasures. His emotions were always on edge, and whenever he began to relax, he found himself compelled to leave behind the joy he had found for something new, which he would then abandon for yet more novelties.</p>\n<p>We had barely explored the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland and formed attachments to some of the locals when the time came to meet our Scottish friend, and we departed to continue our journey. Personally, I wasn't unhappy to leave. I had neglected my promise for some time, and I feared the consequences of the demon's disappointment. He might remain in Switzerland and unleash his vengeance on my family. This thought haunted me, tormenting me at every moment when I might otherwise have found rest and peace. I awaited my letters with anxious impatience; if they were delayed, I was filled with misery and a thousand fears. When they finally arrived, and I saw Elizabeth's or my father's handwriting, I could hardly bring myself to read and discover my fate. Sometimes, I feared that the fiend was pursuing me and might hasten my negligence by murdering my companion. When such thoughts consumed me, I wouldn't leave Henry's side for a moment, following him like a shadow to protect him from the imagined wrath of his pursuer. I felt as if I had committed a terrible crime, the knowledge of which haunted me. I was innocent, yet I had drawn a dreadful curse upon myself, as deadly as any crime. I visited Edinburgh with weary eyes and a heavy mind, and yet that city could have captivated even the most unfortunate soul. Clerval preferred Oxford, as he found its antiquity more appealing. But the beauty and order of Edinburgh's new town, its romantic castle and surroundings—the most delightful in the world, including Arthur’s Seat, St. Bernard’s Well, and the Pentland Hills—made up for the change and filled him with joy and admiration. But I was eager to reach the end of my journey.</p>\n<p>We left Edinburgh after a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrews, and along the banks of the Tay, heading to Perth, where our friend awaited us. However, I was not in the mood for laughter or conversation with strangers, nor did I feel inclined to engage in their feelings or plans with the good humor expected from a guest. So, I told Clerval that I wished to explore Scotland alone. “You enjoy yourself,” I said, “and let this be our meeting point. I may be gone a month or two, but please do not interfere with my plans. I need some peace and solitude for a while, and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more in tune with your spirit.” Henry tried to convince me otherwise, but when he saw my determination, he stopped protesting. He urged me to write often. “I would rather be with you,” he said, “on your solitary walks than with these Scots I don’t know. So, hurry back, my dear friend, so I can feel somewhat at home again, which I can’t do in your absence.”</p>\n<p>After parting from my friend, I resolved to visit some remote corner of Scotland and finish my work in solitude. I had no doubt that the monster would follow me and reveal himself when I completed my task, ready to receive his companion. With this determination, I traversed the northern highlands and chose one of the most isolated Orkney islands as the site for my work. It was a fitting place, little more than a rock constantly battered by the waves. The land was barren, barely able to support a few starving cows and provide oatmeal for its inhabitants, who numbered only five and appeared gaunt and feeble due to their meager diet. Vegetables and bread, when they indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, had to be brought from the mainland, five miles away. Across the entire island, there were only three miserable huts, and one of them was empty when I arrived. I rented it. It had just two rooms, both showing the squalor of extreme poverty. The thatch had caved in, the walls were unplastered, and the door hung off its hinges. I ordered repairs, bought some furniture, and took possession—an event that likely would have surprised anyone, had the villagers not been numbed by their suffering and destitution. As it was, I lived in obscurity and peace, hardly acknowledged for the small amounts of food and clothing I provided, so much does hardship dull even the strongest human senses.</p>\n<p>In this retreat, I spent my mornings working, but in the evenings, when the weather allowed, I walked along the rocky coastline, listening to the waves crash at my feet. It was a monotonous yet ever-changing scene. I thought of Switzerland; it was so different from this desolate and terrifying landscape. Its hills are draped in vines, and its cottages are scattered across the plains. Its beautiful lakes reflect a soft blue sky, and when disturbed by the wind, their turmoil is like a playful child compared to the roars of the mighty ocean. Initially, I divided my time between work and these walks, but as I continued my labor, it became increasingly dreadful and burdensome. Sometimes, I couldn't bring myself to enter my laboratory for days, while at other times, I worked day and night to finish. The process was indeed a filthy one. During my first experiment, a kind of feverish enthusiasm had blinded me to the horror of what I was doing; my mind was intensely focused on the completion of my work, and I was oblivious to the monstrosity of my actions. But now, I approached it with cold detachment, and my heart often turned at the sight of what I was creating. In this isolated setting, engaged in the most abhorrent task, my spirits became unstable; I grew restless and anxious. Every moment, I feared encountering my tormentor. Sometimes I sat staring at the ground, too afraid to lift my eyes for fear of seeing the very being I dreaded so much. I was cautious not to stray from the sight of other people, fearing that when alone, he would come to claim his companion. Meanwhile, I worked on, and my project was already significantly advanced. I looked toward its completion with a trembling, eager hope, one I dared not question, mixed with vague forebodings of evil that made my heart sink within me.</p>",

      "original": "<div class=\"chapter\" id=\"pgepubid00026\"> <h2><a id=\"chap20\">Chapter 20</a></h2><a id=\"chap20\"> <p> I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just rising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and I remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention to it. As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to consider the effects of what I was now doing. Three years before, I was engaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled barbarity had desolated my heart and filled it for ever with the bitterest remorse. I was now about to form another being of whose dispositions I was alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her mate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness. He had sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she had not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and reasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her creation. They might even hate each other; the creature who already lived loathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it came before his eyes in the female form? She also might turn with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him, and he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being deserted by one of his own species. </p>\n<p> Even if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world, yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the dæmon thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror. Had I right, for my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? I had before been moved by the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless by his fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race. </p>\n<p> I trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw by the light of the moon the dæmon at the casement. A ghastly grin wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task which he had allotted to me. Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the fulfilment of my promise. </p>\n<p> As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of malice and treachery. I thought with a sensation of madness on my promise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion, tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged. The wretch saw me destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for happiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew. </p>\n<p> I left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own heart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I sought my own apartment. I was alone; none were near me to dissipate the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most terrible reveries. </p>\n<p> Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea; it was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature reposed under the eye of the quiet moon. A few fishing vessels alone specked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound of voices as the fishermen called to one another. I felt the silence, although I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a person landed close to my house. </p>\n<p> In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one endeavoured to open it softly. I trembled from head to foot; I felt a presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation of helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain endeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot. </p>\n<p> Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door opened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared. Shutting the door, he approached me and said in a smothered voice, </p>\n<p> “You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you intend? Do you dare to break your promise? I have endured toil and misery; I left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among its willow islands and over the summits of its hills. I have dwelt many months in the heaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland. I have endured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my hopes?” </p>\n<p> “Begone! I do break my promise; never will I create another like yourself, equal in deformity and wickedness.” </p>\n<p> “Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself unworthy of my condescension. Remember that I have power; you believe yourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of day will be hateful to you. You are my creator, but I am your master; obey!” </p>\n<p> “The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power is arrived. Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in vice. Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a dæmon whose delight is in death and wretchedness? Begone! I am firm, and your words will only exasperate my rage.” </p>\n<p> The monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the impotence of anger. “Shall each man,” cried he, “find a wife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone? I had feelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn. Man! You may hate, but beware! Your hours will pass in dread and misery, and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for ever. Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness? You can blast my other passions, but revenge remains—revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food! I may die, but first you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your misery. Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful. I will watch with the wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom. Man, you shall repent of the injuries you inflict.” </p>\n<p> “Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice. I have declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend beneath words. Leave me; I am inexorable.” </p>\n<p> “It is well. I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your wedding-night.” </p>\n<p> I started forward and exclaimed, “Villain! Before you sign my death-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe.” </p>\n<p> I would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with precipitation. In a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the waves. </p>\n<p> All was again silent, but his words rang in my ears. I burned with rage to pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean. I walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me. Why had I not followed him and closed with him in mortal strife? But I had suffered him to depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland. I shuddered to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge. And then I thought again of his words—“<i>I will be with you on your wedding-night.</i>” That, then, was the period fixed for the fulfilment of my destiny. In that hour I should die and at once satisfy and extinguish his malice. The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I thought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first I had shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall before my enemy without a bitter struggle. </p>\n<p> The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became calmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into the depths of despair. I left the house, the horrid scene of the last night’s contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me. I desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true, but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. If I returned, it was to be sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a dæmon whom I had myself created. </p>\n<p> I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it loved and miserable in the separation. When it became noon, and the sun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep sleep. I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery. The sleep into which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as if I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the words of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared like a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality. </p>\n<p> The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet; it contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to join him. He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where he was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his Indian enterprise. He could not any longer delay his departure; but as his journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he now conjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of my society on him as I could spare. He besought me, therefore, to leave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed southwards together. This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and I determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days. </p>\n<p> Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered to reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me. The next morning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door of my laboratory. The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had mangled the living flesh of a human being. I paused to collect myself and then entered the chamber. With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments out of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly put them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them up, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the meantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus. </p>\n<p> Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dæmon. I had before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film had been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw clearly. The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it. I had resolved in my own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different conclusion. </p>\n<p> Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore. The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land, but I sailed away from them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my fellow creatures. At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of darkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound as it sank and then sailed away from the spot. The sky became clouded, but the air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then rising. But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the moon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as its keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I slept soundly. </p>\n<p> I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I found that the sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was high, and the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I found that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from which I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found that if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with water. Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind. I confess that I felt a few sensations of terror. I had no compass with me and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the world that the sun was of little benefit to me. I might be driven into the wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me. I had already been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to my other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon the sea; it was to be my grave. “Fiend,” I exclaimed, “your task is already fulfilled!” I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and of Clerval—all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his sanguinary and merciless passions. This idea plunged me into a reverie so despairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of closing before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it. </p>\n<p> Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became free from breakers. But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick and hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high land towards the south. </p>\n<p> Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes. </p>\n<p> How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have of life even in the excess of misery! I constructed another sail with a part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land. It had a wild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived the traces of cultivation. I saw vessels near the shore and found myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man. I carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at length saw issuing from behind a small promontory. As I was in a state of extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place where I could most easily procure nourishment. Fortunately I had money with me. As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected escape. </p>\n<p> As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several people crowded towards the spot. They seemed much surprised at my appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me a slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they spoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language. “My good friends,” said I, “will you be so kind as to tell me the name of this town and inform me where I am?” </p>\n<p> “You will know that soon enough,” replied a man with a hoarse voice. “Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste, but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.” </p>\n<p> I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a stranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry countenances of his companions. “Why do you answer me so roughly?” I replied. “Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably.” </p>\n<p> “I do not know,” said the man, “what the custom of the English may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.” </p>\n<p> While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly increase. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which annoyed and in some degree alarmed me. I inquired the way to the inn, but no one replied. I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the crowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Come, sir, you must follow me to Mr. Kirwin’s to give an account of yourself.” </p>\n<p> “Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an account of myself? Is not this a free country?” </p>\n<p> “Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate, and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was found murdered here last night.” </p>\n<p> This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself. I was innocent; that could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in silence and was led to one of the best houses in the town. I was ready to sink from fatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into apprehension or conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy or death. </p>\n<p> I must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of the frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my recollection. </p> </a></div>",
      "modern": "<p>Chapter 20</p>\n<p>One evening, I sat in my laboratory. The sun had set, and the moon was just rising from the sea. I didn’t have enough light for my work, and I hesitated, considering whether to leave my task for the night or to push through and finish it. As I sat there, I began to reflect on the consequences of what I was doing. Three years earlier, I had been engaged in a similar task, creating a monster whose unmatched cruelty had devastated my heart and filled it with deep remorse.</p>\n<p>Now, I was about to create another being, but I had no idea what her nature would be. She could be far more malevolent than the first and take pleasure in murder and misery for its own sake. He had sworn to leave humanity behind and hide in the wilderness, but she had not made such a promise. As a thinking and reasoning creature, she might refuse to uphold a contract made before her existence. They might even hate each other. The creature I had brought to life despised his own deformity; wouldn’t he be filled with even greater loathing when he saw it reflected in a female form? She might turn away from him, drawn instead to the beauty of humans. If that happened, he would be left alone again, filled with rage from being abandoned by someone of his own kind.</p>\n<p>Even if they left Europe and settled in the wilderness of the New World, the desires that drove him would lead to children, creating a race of monsters that could threaten the very survival of humanity. Did I have the right to impose this curse on future generations for my own benefit? Previously, I had been swayed by the arguments of the creature I had created; I had been struck mute by his fiendish threats. But now, for the first time, the wickedness of my promise hit me hard. I shuddered at the thought that future generations might curse me as their plague, whose selfishness had sought peace at the possible cost of the entire human race.</p>\n<p>I trembled, my heart heavy with dread, when I glanced up and saw, illuminated by the moonlight, the monster at the window. A ghastly grin twisted his lips as he looked at me, watching me carry out the task he had set for me. He had followed me throughout my travels; he had lingered in forests, hidden in caves, or sought refuge in desolate moors. Now, he came to observe my progress and demand that I fulfill my promise. As I looked at him, his face radiated pure malice and treachery. I was gripped by a fit of madness as I recalled my promise to create another like him. Overcome with rage, I tore apart the work I had been doing.</p>\n<p>The wretch watched me destroy the creature upon which his happiness depended, and with a howl of despair and vengeance, he withdrew. I left the room, locked the door, and made a solemn vow in my heart never to resume my work. Then, with shaky steps, I returned to my own room. I was alone; no one was there to break the gloom or relieve me from the suffocating weight of my terrible thoughts.</p>\n<p>Several hours passed as I sat by my window, staring at the sea. It was nearly calm, the winds hushed, and all of nature rested beneath the watchful eye of the tranquil moon. A few fishing boats dotted the water, and occasionally, I could hear the soft sounds of fishermen calling to one another. I felt the silence, though I was only vaguely aware of its depth, until suddenly my attention was caught by the sound of oars paddling near the shore, and I noticed someone land close to my house.</p>\n<p>A few minutes later, I heard my door creaking as if someone were trying to open it quietly. I trembled from head to toe, sensing who it was. I wanted to wake one of the nearby peasants who lived in a cottage not far from mine, but I was paralyzed by a feeling of helplessness, like in a nightmare when you try to flee from an approaching danger but can’t move. Soon, I heard footsteps in the hallway; the door opened, and the creature I feared appeared. He shut the door and approached me, speaking in a low, strained voice.</p>\n<p>“You have destroyed the work you started; what do you intend to do? Do you dare to break your promise? I have endured toil and misery. I left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, through its willow islands, and over the peaks of its hills. I have spent months in the heaths of England and the deserts of Scotland. I have suffered immense fatigue, cold, and hunger; do you dare to destroy my hopes?”</p>\n<p>“Get out! I do break my promise; I will never create another like you, equal in deformity and wickedness.”</p>\n<p>“Slave, I reasoned with you before, but you have shown yourself unworthy of my patience. Remember that I have power; you think you’re miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of day will become unbearable. You are my creator, but I am your master; obey!”</p>\n<p>“The time for my indecision is over, and your power has arrived. Your threats won’t push me to commit a wicked act; they only strengthen my resolve not to create a companion for you in vice. Should I, in cold blood, unleash a monster upon the earth whose joy lies in death and suffering? Get out! I am resolute, and your words will only fuel my anger.”</p>\n<p>The monster saw my determination and gnashed his teeth in impotent rage. “Shall every man find a partner, while I remain alone? I had feelings of affection, and they were met with hatred and scorn. You may hate, but beware! Your days will be filled with dread and misery, and soon the moment will come when your happiness will be ripped away forever. Will you be happy while I suffer in my wretchedness? You can destroy my other passions, but revenge remains—revenge, now more precious than light or food! I may die, but before that, you, my tyrant and tormentor, will curse the sun that shines upon your misery. Beware, for I am fearless and thus powerful. I will watch you like a snake, ready to strike with its venom. You will regret the injuries you inflict.”</p>\n<p>“Devil, stop; do not poison the air with your malicious words. I have declared my decision to you, and I am no coward to bend to threats. Leave me; I am unyielding.”</p>\n<p>“It is well. I go, but remember, I will be with you on your wedding night.”</p>\n<p>I jumped forward and shouted, “Villain! Before you sign my death warrant, make sure you are safe yourself.” I tried to grab him, but he slipped away and left the house in a hurry. Moments later, I saw him in his boat, cutting across the water with incredible speed, soon disappearing into the waves.</p>\n<p>Silence returned, but his words echoed in my mind. I burned with rage to hunt down the murderer of my peace and plunge him into the ocean. I paced my room, agitated, while my imagination conjured up countless tormenting images. Why hadn’t I followed him and confronted him in a deadly struggle? But I had let him escape, and he was heading toward the mainland. The thought of who might be his next victim, sacrificed to his endless revenge, made me shudder. Then I recalled his words—“I will be with you on your wedding night.” That was the time set for the fulfillment of my fate. In that moment, I would die, satisfying and ending his malice. The thought didn’t fill me with fear, but when I thought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow upon discovering her lover had been brutally taken from her, tears—the first I had shed in months—streamed down my face. I resolved that I wouldn’t fall before my enemy without a fierce fight.</p>\n<p>The night passed, and the sun rose from the ocean. My feelings grew calmer, if calmness could be described as the violent rage sinking into despair. I left the house, that dreadful site of the previous night’s conflict, and walked along the beach, which I almost viewed as an impenetrable barrier between myself and humanity. A part of me wished that it would remain that way. I longed to spend my life on that barren rock, wearisome as it might be, but free from any sudden shock of despair. If I returned, it would be to face sacrifice or to witness the death of those I loved, killed by the monster I had brought into existence. I wandered the island like a restless ghost, separated from everything I loved and miserable in that separation.</p>\n<p>By noon, as the sun rose higher, I lay down on the grass, overtaken by a deep sleep. I had been awake the entire previous night, my nerves frayed and my eyes inflamed from watching and distress. The sleep I now fell into refreshed me. When I awoke, I felt more like a human being, and I began to reflect on what had happened with greater calmness. Yet still, the monster’s words echoed in my ears like a death knell; they felt like a dream, yet distinct and heavy as reality.</p>\n<p>The sun had dipped low, and I was still sitting on the shore, satisfying my ravenous hunger with a piece of bread when I noticed a fishing boat land nearby. One of the men approached me with a packet; it contained letters from Geneva, including one from Clerval urging me to join him. He wrote that he was wasting time fruitlessly where he was, that friends he had made in London wanted him to return to finalize the negotiations for his Indian venture. He could no longer delay his departure, but since his journey to London might soon lead to a longer voyage, he begged me to spend as much time with him as I could. He implored me to leave my solitary isle and meet him in Perth so we could travel south together.</p>\n<p>This letter somewhat revived my spirits, and I decided to leave my island in two days. But before I departed, there was a task I dreaded—packing my chemical instruments, which meant entering the room where I had committed my abhorrent work and handling the tools that now sickened me.</p>\n<p>The next morning, at dawn, I gathered my courage and unlocked the door to my laboratory. The remains of the half-finished creature I had destroyed lay scattered on the floor, and I nearly felt like I was mutilating the living flesh of a human being. I paused to steady myself and then entered the chamber. With trembling hands, I carried the instruments out of the room, but I realized I couldn’t leave the remnants of my work to inspire horror and suspicion among the villagers. So, I placed them in a basket with a large amount of stones and resolved to throw them into the sea that very night. In the meantime, I sat on the beach, cleaning and organizing my chemical apparatus.</p>\n<p>Nothing could compare to the complete change in my feelings since that night when the monster appeared. I had previously viewed my promise with a gloomy despair as something that, regardless of the consequences, had to be fulfilled. But now, it felt as if a veil had been lifted from my eyes, and for the first time, I saw clearly. The thought of continuing my work didn’t even cross my mind; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I didn’t realize that a voluntary action of mine could prevent it. I had resolved that creating another like the fiend I had first made would be the most atrocious act of selfishness, and I banished any thoughts that might lead me to a different conclusion.</p>\n<p>Between two and three in the morning, the moon rose. I took my basket and, boarding a small skiff, sailed out about four miles from shore. The scene was completely solitary; a few boats were returning to land, but I steered away from them, feeling as though I was about to commit a terrible crime, and I avoided any encounter with others with shivering anxiety. At one point, the once-clear moon was suddenly obscured by thick clouds, and I seized the moment of darkness to cast my basket into the sea. I listened to the gurgling sound as it sank and then sailed away from the spot.</p>\n<p>The sky turned cloudy, but the air was fresh, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was picking up. It refreshed me and filled me with such pleasant sensations that I decided to prolong my time on the water. Fixing the rudder in place, I lay down at the bottom of the boat. Clouds obscured the moon, everything was dark, and I could only hear the sound of the boat slicing through the waves. The murmur lulled me, and soon I fell into a deep sleep.</p>\n<p>I don’t know how long I stayed in that state, but when I awoke, I found the sun had risen considerably. The wind was strong, and the waves continually threatened my little skiff. I realized the wind was blowing northeast, driving me far from the coast where I had set out. I tried to change my course but quickly found that if I attempted again, my boat would fill with water. In that predicament, my only option was to sail before the wind.</p>\n<p>I admit I felt some terror. I had no compass with me and was only vaguely familiar with the geography of this area, so the sun offered little help. I could be swept into the vast Atlantic, facing all the torments of starvation, or be swallowed by the endless waters that churned around me. I had already been out for many hours and felt the agony of burning thirst, a precursor to my other sufferings. I looked up at the sky, which was covered by clouds racing before the wind, only to be replaced by others. I looked at the sea; it was to be my grave.</p>\n<p>“Fiend,” I exclaimed, “your task is already fulfilled!” I thought of Elizabeth, my father, and Clerval—all left behind, vulnerable to the monster’s merciless rage. This thought plunged me into a despair so deep and terrifying that even now, as my life nears its end, I shudder to recall it.</p>\n<p>Hours passed like this, but gradually, as the sun descended toward the horizon, the wind calmed into a gentle breeze, and the sea became free of tumult. However, the heavy swell remained; I felt nauseated and barely able to hold the rudder when suddenly, I spotted a line of high land to the south. Almost spent from fatigue and the horror of my prolonged suspense, this sudden certainty of life flooded my heart with joy, and tears streamed down my face.</p>\n<p>How changeable our feelings are, and how strange is that enduring love we have for life, even in the depths of misery! I fashioned another sail from part of my clothing and eagerly steered toward the land. It appeared wild and rocky, but as I drew closer, I noticed signs of cultivation. I saw vessels near the shore and felt myself suddenly transported back to the realm of civilized people. I carefully followed the land’s contours and spotted a steeple rising from behind a small promontory.</p>\n<p>In a state of extreme exhaustion, I resolved to sail directly toward the town, believing it would be the easiest place to find nourishment. Fortunately, I had money with me. As I rounded the promontory, I saw a small, tidy town and a good harbor. I entered, my heart racing with joy at my unexpected escape.</p>\n<p>While I was busy securing my boat and rearranging the sails, several people gathered nearby. They seemed surprised by my appearance, but instead of helping me, they whispered among themselves, their gestures causing me some concern. As it was, I noticed they spoke English, so I addressed them in that language.</p>\n<p>“My good friends,” I said, “could you please tell me the name of this town and where I am?”</p>\n<p>“You’ll find that out soon enough,” replied a man with a gruff voice. “Perhaps you’ve come to a place that won’t suit you, but I promise you won’t be consulted about your accommodations.”</p>\n<p>I was taken aback by such a rude response from a stranger, and I felt uneasy as I observed the scowling faces of his companions. “Why do you answer me so harshly?” I replied. “Surely it isn't customary for Englishmen to treat strangers so inhospitably.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know what the customs of the English are, but it’s customary for the Irish to despise villains.”</p>\n<p>As this strange conversation continued, I noticed the crowd growing rapidly. Their faces showed a mix of curiosity and anger, which annoyed and somewhat alarmed me. I asked for directions to the inn, but no one replied. I moved forward, and a murmur arose from the crowd as they followed and surrounded me. An unkempt man approached, tapped me on the shoulder, and said, “Come, sir, you must follow me to Mr. Kirwin’s to explain yourself.”</p>\n<p>“Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why must I account for myself? Isn’t this a free country?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir, free enough for honest folk. Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate, and you are to explain the death of a gentleman who was found murdered here last night.”</p>\n<p>This startled me, but I quickly regained my composure. I was innocent; that could easily be proven. So, I followed my guide in silence, led to one of the best houses in town. Exhausted and hungry, I felt I had to muster all my strength, so no sign of physical weakness could be misinterpreted as apprehension or guilt.</p>\n<p>Little did I expect the calamity that was about to overwhelm me and extinguish all fear of disgrace or death in horror and despair. I must pause here; it requires all my strength to recall the terrifying events I am about to recount in proper detail.</p>",

      "original": "<div class=\"chapter\" id=\"pgepubid00027\"> <h2><a id=\"chap21\">Chapter 21</a></h2><a id=\"chap21\"> <p> I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old benevolent man with calm and mild manners. He looked upon me, however, with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors, he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion. </p>\n<p> About half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o’clock, they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in for port. It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about two miles below. He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle, and his companions followed him at some distance. As he was proceeding along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his length on the ground. His companions came up to assist him, and by the light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man, who was to all appearance dead. Their first supposition was that it was the corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the waves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even that the body was not then cold. They instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it to life. It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty years of age. He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck. </p>\n<p> The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but when the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for support. The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew an unfavourable augury from my manner. </p>\n<p> The son confirmed his father’s account, but when Daniel Nugent was called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore; and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same boat in which I had just landed. </p>\n<p> A woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door of her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour before she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards found. </p>\n<p> Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the body into her house; it was not cold. They put it into a bed and rubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was quite gone. </p>\n<p> Several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed that, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it was very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed. Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body from another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to know the shore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of —— from the place where I had deposited the corpse. </p>\n<p> Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into the room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what effect the sight of it would produce upon me. This idea was probably suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the murder had been described. I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate and several other persons, to the inn. I could not help being struck by the strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but, knowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I had inhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectly tranquil as to the consequences of the affair. </p>\n<p> I entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin. How can I describe my sensations on beholding it? I feel yet parched with horror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and agony. The examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses, passed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry Clerval stretched before me. I gasped for breath, and throwing myself on the body, I exclaimed, “Have my murderous machinations deprived you also, my dearest Henry, of life? Two I have already destroyed; other victims await their destiny; but you, Clerval, my friend, my benefactor—” </p>\n<p> The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and I was carried out of the room in strong convulsions. </p>\n<p> A fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death; my ravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the murderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated my attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was tormented; and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror. Fortunately, as I spoke my native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses. </p>\n<p> Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not sink into forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming children, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of what materials was I made that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of the wheel, continually renewed the torture? </p>\n<p> But I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from a dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by gaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon. It was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which I was, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly. </p>\n<p> This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside me. She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise that class. The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of persons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery. Her tone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English, and the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings. </p>\n<p> “Are you better now, sir?” said she. </p>\n<p> I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, “I believe I am; but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am still alive to feel this misery and horror.” </p>\n<p> “For that matter,” replied the old woman, “if you mean about the gentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you were dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you! However, that’s none of my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty with a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.” </p>\n<p> I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a speech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed. The whole series of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force of reality. </p>\n<p> As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me. The physician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared them for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the second. Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the hangman who would gain his fee? </p>\n<p> These were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had shown me extreme kindness. He had caused the best room in the prison to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who had provided a physician and a nurse. It is true, he seldom came to see me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of every human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and miserable ravings of a murderer. He came, therefore, sometimes to see that I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long intervals. </p>\n<p> One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes half open and my cheeks livid like those in death. I was overcome by gloom and misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. At one time I considered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the penalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been. Such were my thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered. His countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to mine and addressed me in French, </p>\n<p> “I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything to make you more comfortable?” </p>\n<p> “I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole earth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.” </p>\n<p> “I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune. But you will, I hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.” </p>\n<p> “That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, become the most miserable of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am and have been, can death be any evil to me?” </p>\n<p> “Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the strange chances that have lately occurred. You were thrown, by some surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality, seized immediately, and charged with murder. The first sight that was presented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so unaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across your path.” </p>\n<p> As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on this retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me. I suppose some astonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastened to say, </p>\n<p> “Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on your person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some trace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune and illness. I found several letters, and, among others, one which I discovered from its commencement to be from your father. I instantly wrote to Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter. But you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any kind.” </p>\n<p> “This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event; tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am now to lament?” </p>\n<p> “Your family is perfectly well,” said Mr. Kirwin with gentleness; “and someone, a friend, is come to visit you.” </p>\n<p> I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my misery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for me to comply with his hellish desires. I put my hand before my eyes, and cried out in agony, </p>\n<p> “Oh! Take him away! I cannot see him; for God’s sake, do not let him enter!” </p>\n<p> Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance. He could not help regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in rather a severe tone, </p>\n<p> “I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.” </p>\n<p> “My father!” cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed from anguish to pleasure. “Is my father indeed come? How kind, how very kind! But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?” </p>\n<p> My change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium, and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence. He rose and quitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it. </p>\n<p> Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the arrival of my father. I stretched out my hand to him and cried, </p>\n<p> “Are you then safe—and Elizabeth—and Ernest?” </p>\n<p> My father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my desponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of cheerfulness. “What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!” said he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance of the room. “You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems to pursue you. And poor Clerval—” </p>\n<p> The name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too great to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears. </p>\n<p> “Alas! Yes, my father,” replied I; “some destiny of the most horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I should have died on the coffin of Henry.” </p>\n<p> We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that could ensure tranquillity. Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion. But the appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I gradually recovered my health. </p>\n<p> As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black melancholy that nothing could dissipate. The image of Clerval was for ever before me, ghastly and murdered. More than once the agitation into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous relapse. Alas! Why did they preserve so miserable and detested a life? It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now drawing to a close. Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears me to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also sink to rest. Then the appearance of death was distant, although the wish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours motionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins. </p>\n<p> The season of the assizes approached. I had already been three months in prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a relapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country town where the court was held. Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence. I was spared the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not brought before the court that decides on life and death. The grand jury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney Islands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight after my removal I was liberated from prison. </p>\n<p> My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a criminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country. I did not participate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a palace were alike hateful. The cup of life was poisoned for ever, and although the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me. Sometimes they were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed them; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as I first saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt. </p>\n<p> My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. He talked of Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but these words only drew deep groans from me. Sometimes, indeed, I felt a wish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved cousin or longed, with a devouring <i>maladie du pays</i>, to see once more the blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early childhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and despair. At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the existence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence. </p>\n<p> Yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally triumphed over my selfish despair. It was necessary that I should return without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those I so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to blast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to the existence of the monstrous image which I had endued with the mockery of a soul still more monstrous. My father still desired to delay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of a journey, for I was a shattered wreck—the shadow of a human being. My strength was gone. I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day preyed upon my wasted frame. </p>\n<p> Still, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience, my father thought it best to yield. We took our passage on board a vessel bound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores. It was midnight. I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to the dashing of the waves. I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should soon see Geneva. The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream; yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly that I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearest companion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. I repassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing with my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for Ingolstadt. I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on to the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in which he first lived. I was unable to pursue the train of thought; a thousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly. </p>\n<p> Ever since my recovery from the fever, I had been in the custom of taking every night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drug only that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of life. Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly. But sleep did not afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a thousand objects that scared me. Towards morning I was possessed by a kind of nightmare; I felt the fiend’s grasp in my neck and could not free myself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears. My father, who was watching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves were around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of security, a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour and the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm forgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly susceptible. </p> </a></div>",
      "modern": "<p>Chapter 21</p>\n<p>I was soon brought before the magistrate, an elderly and kind man with a calm demeanor. However, he regarded me with a certain severity, then turned to my escorts and inquired who the witnesses were in this case. About half a dozen men stepped forward, and one was chosen by the magistrate to testify. He stated that he had been fishing the night before with his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent. Around ten o’clock, they noticed a strong northern wind picking up and decided to head back to port. It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they didn’t land at the harbor but, as was their custom, at a creek about two miles downstream. He walked ahead, carrying part of the fishing gear, while his companions followed at a distance. As he walked along the shore, he tripped over something and fell to the ground. His companions rushed to help him, and by the glow of their lantern, they discovered that he had fallen on the body of a man who appeared to be dead. Initially, they thought it was the corpse of someone who had drowned and been washed ashore by the waves, but upon closer examination, they found that the clothes were dry and the body was not yet cold. They quickly took it to the nearby cottage of an elderly woman and tried, but unsuccessfully, to revive him. The man looked to be a handsome young man, around twenty-five years old. It seemed he had been strangled, as there were no signs of violence except for the black marks of fingers around his neck.</p>\n<p>The first part of this testimony didn’t interest me at all, but when the finger marks were mentioned, I remembered my brother’s murder and felt a wave of intense agitation. My limbs trembled, and a fog came over my eyes, forcing me to lean against a chair for support. The magistrate observed me closely and, understandably, drew an unfavorable conclusion from my behavior. The son confirmed his father’s account, but when Daniel Nugent was called to speak, he swore that just before his companion’s fall, he had seen a boat with a single man in it a short distance from the shore; and from what he could tell by the light of a few stars, it was the same boat I had just arrived in. A woman testified that she lived near the beach and was standing at her cottage door, waiting for the fishermen’s return, about an hour before she heard about the discovery of the body. She saw a boat with only one man push off from the area where the corpse was later found. Another woman confirmed that the fishermen had brought the body into her house; it was not cold. They placed it in a bed and rubbed it, while Daniel went to town for a doctor, but all efforts were in vain.</p>\n<p>Several other men were questioned about my arrival, and they agreed that, given the strong northern wind that had picked up during the night, it was very likely I had struggled against it for many hours and had been forced to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed. They also noted that it seemed I had brought the body from another location, and since I appeared unfamiliar with the shore, it was possible I had entered the harbor unaware of how far the town of —— was from where I had left the corpse. Mr. Kirwin, upon hearing this evidence, requested that I be taken into the room where the body lay so that they could observe my reaction to seeing it. This idea was likely prompted by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the nature of the murder was described. I was escorted by the magistrate and several others to the inn. I couldn’t help but be struck by the bizarre coincidences that had transpired that fateful night; still, knowing that I had been conversing with several people on the island around the time the body was found, I felt completely at ease regarding the outcome of the situation.</p>\n<p>I entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin. How can I express the sensations I felt upon seeing it? Even now, I feel parched with horror, and I cannot reflect on that dreadful moment without shuddering in agony. The examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses, faded from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry Clerval stretched before me. I gasped for breath, and throwing myself onto the body, I cried out, “Have my murderous schemes taken you from me too, my dearest Henry? I have already destroyed two; other victims await their fate, but you, Clerval, my friend, my benefactor—” My body could no longer endure the pain I felt, and I was carried out of the room in violent convulsions.</p>\n<p>A fever followed. I lay on the brink of death for two months; my ravings, as I would later hear, were horrifying. I called myself the murderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I begged my attendants to help me destroy the fiend that tormented me; at other times, I felt the monster’s fingers already clutching my neck, screaming in agony and terror. Fortunately, since I spoke my native language, only Mr. Kirwin understood me; my gestures and bitter cries were enough to frighten the other witnesses. Why did I not die? More wretched than any man had ever been, why did I not sink into oblivion and find peace? Death claims many blooming children, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and young lovers are filled with health and hope one day, and the next, are food for worms and decay? What was I made of that I could resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of a wheel, continuously renewed my suffering? But I was doomed to live, and after two months, I found myself awakening from a dream, in a prison, stretched out on a wretched bed, surrounded by jailers, keys, bolts, and all the miserable trappings of a dungeon.</p>\n<p>I remember waking in the morning, having forgotten the details of what had happened, feeling as if some great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me. But when I looked around and saw the barred windows and the squalor of the room, everything came rushing back to me, and I groaned bitterly. My sound disturbed an old woman sleeping in a chair beside me. She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the jailers, and her face showed all the rough qualities that often characterize that class. The lines on her face were hard and cruel, like someone used to seeing suffering without sympathy. Her tone showed complete indifference; she spoke to me in English, and her voice reminded me of one I had heard during my suffering. “Are you feeling better now, sir?” she asked. I replied weakly, “I believe I am; but if it’s all true, if I didn’t dream, I’m sorry to still be alive to feel this misery and horror.”</p>\n<p>“To that matter,” the old woman replied, “if you’re talking about the gentleman you murdered, I think it would be better for you if you were dead, because I suspect it will go hard for you! But that’s not my concern; I’m here to nurse you back to health; I do my job with a clear conscience; it would be nice if everyone did the same.” I turned away in disgust from the woman who could say such a heartless thing to someone just saved, on the brink of death; but I felt weak and unable to contemplate all that had happened. My entire life felt like a dream; sometimes I wondered if it were all true, as it never felt real to me. As the images before me grew clearer, I became feverish; darkness closed in around me; no one was near to comfort me with a loving voice; no dear hand supported me.</p>\n<p>The doctor came and prescribed medications, and the old woman prepared them for me; but utter indifference was evident in the doctor, while brutality was clearly marked on the face of the old woman. Who could care about the fate of a murderer other than the hangman expecting his fee? These were my first thoughts, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had shown me great kindness. He had arranged for the best room in the prison to be prepared for me (although it was still miserable), and he had provided me with a doctor and a nurse. It’s true he seldom visited, as he fervently wished to alleviate the suffering of every human being but did not want to witness the agonies and miserable ravings of a murderer. Therefore, he came to check that I was not neglected, but his visits were brief and infrequent.</p>\n<p>One day, while I was gradually recovering, I sat in a chair, my eyes half-open and my cheeks as pale as death. I was overcome with gloom and misery and often thought it would be better to seek death than remain in a world filled with wretchedness. At one point, I considered confessing my guilt and facing the law’s punishment, less innocent than poor Justine had been. Such were my thoughts when the door to my room opened and Mr. Kirwin entered. His face expressed sympathy and compassion; he moved a chair closer to mine and addressed me in French, “I fear this place is very distressing for you; can I do anything to make you more comfortable?”</p>\n<p>“I thank you, but nothing you can do matters to me; on this whole earth, there is no comfort I am capable of receiving.”</p>\n<p>“I know that the sympathy of a stranger can only offer little relief to someone weighed down by such a strange misfortune. But I hope you will soon leave this gloomy place, as I’m sure evidence can easily be found to clear you of the criminal charges.”</p>\n<p>“That is my least concern; by a series of strange events, I have become the most miserable of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am, can death be any worse for me?”</p>\n<p>“Nothing could be more unfortunate and agonizing than the strange circumstances that have occurred. You were thrown, by some surprising accident, onto this shore, known for its hospitality, immediately seized, and charged with murder. The first sight that greeted you was the body of your friend, killed in such an inexplicable manner and placed, as if by some fiend, across your path.”</p>\n<p>As Mr. Kirwin spoke, despite the turmoil I felt remembering my suffering, I was also surprised by how much he seemed to know about me. I must have shown my astonishment on my face because Mr. Kirwin quickly added, “As soon as you fell ill, all the papers you had on you were brought to me, and I examined them to find some way to inform your family about your misfortune and illness. I found several letters, including one from your father. I immediately wrote to Geneva; nearly two months have passed since my letter was sent. But you are ill; even now you tremble; you are not fit for any kind of agitation.”</p>\n<p>“This uncertainty is a thousand times worse than the most horrifying event; tell me what new tragedy has unfolded, and whose murder I am now to mourn?”</p>\n<p>“Your family is perfectly well,” Mr. Kirwin said gently; “and someone, a friend, has come to visit you.”</p>\n<p>I don’t know how the thought came to me, but it immediately struck me that the murderer had come to mock my misery and taunt me with Clerval’s death, as a new provocation for me to comply with his hellish desires. I covered my eyes with my hand and cried out in despair, “Oh! Take him away! I cannot see him; for God’s sake, do not let him enter!”</p>\n<p>Mr. Kirwin looked at me with a troubled expression. He understandably interpreted my outburst as a sign of my guilt and said in a rather stern tone, “I would have thought that your father’s presence would be welcome, rather than inspire such violent aversion.”</p>\n<p>“My father!” I cried, every feature and muscle relaxing from agony to joy. “Is my father really here? How kind, how very kind! But where is he? Why doesn’t he hurry to me?”</p>\n<p>My sudden change in demeanor surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he thought my earlier outburst was just a momentary return to delirium, and he quickly resumed his earlier kindness. He rose and left the room with my nurse, and shortly after, my father entered. Nothing at that moment could have given me greater joy than my father’s arrival. I reached out my hand to him and exclaimed, “Are you safe—and Elizabeth—and Ernest?”</p>\n<p>My father calmed me with assurances of their well-being and tried to lift my spirits by talking about topics that warmed my heart; but he soon realized that a prison cannot be a place of cheer. “What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!” he said, gazing mournfully at the barred windows and the miserable state of the room. “You traveled to seek happiness, but a cruel fate seems to pursue you. And poor Clerval—”</p>\n<p>Hearing the name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was too much for my weak state, and I began to cry. “Alas! Yes, my father,” I replied; “some terrible destiny hangs over me, and I must live to fulfill it, or I should have surely died on Henry’s coffin.”</p>\n<p>We were not allowed to talk for long, as my health was precarious, and every precaution was necessary to ensure my tranquility. Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my strength should not be drained by too much exertion. But my father’s appearance felt like the arrival of a guardian angel, and I slowly began to regain my health.</p>\n<p>As my illness lifted, I was consumed by a gloomy and deep melancholy that nothing could dispel. The image of Clerval haunted me, ghastly and murdered. More than once, the agitation these memories caused made my friends fear a dangerous relapse. Alas! Why did they keep me alive in such misery and despair? Surely it was so I might fulfill my destiny, which is now drawing to a close. Soon, oh, very soon, death will extinguish these throbbings and relieve me of the heavy burden of anguish that presses me to the ground; and in executing justice, I too shall find rest.</p>\n<p>Though the prospect of death was still distant, the desire for it constantly occupied my thoughts; I often sat for hours, motionless and silent, wishing for some great upheaval that might bury me and my destroyer beneath its ruins. The time for the trial approached. I had already spent three months in prison, and although I was still weak and in constant danger of a relapse, I was required to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country town where the court was held. Mr. Kirwin took it upon himself to gather witnesses and organize my defense. I was spared the shame of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not brought before the court that decides life and death. The grand jury dismissed the charges when it was proven that I had been on the Orkney Islands at the time my friend’s body was found; and two weeks after my transfer, I was released from prison.</p>\n<p>My father was overjoyed to see me free from the burdens of a criminal accusation, that I was once again allowed to breathe fresh air and return to my homeland. I did not share in his joy, for to me, the walls of a dungeon or a palace were equally loathsome. The cup of life was forever poisoned, and although the sun shone on me, as it did on the happy and light-hearted, I saw nothing around me but a thick and terrifying darkness, pierced only by the glimmer of two eyes glaring at me. Sometimes they were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that framed them; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as I first saw them in my room at Ingolstadt.</p>\n<p>My father tried to rekindle in me feelings of affection. He talked about Geneva, which I would soon visit, about Elizabeth and Ernest; but these words only drew deep groans from me. Sometimes I did feel a fleeting wish for happiness and thought with a bittersweet longing of my beloved cousin, or pined, with a consuming homesickness, to once again see the blue lake and the swift Rhône that had been so dear to me in childhood; but my overall state of mind was one of lethargy, where a prison felt as welcome as the most beautiful scene in nature, and these moments of yearning were rarely interrupted except by fits of anguish and despair.</p>\n<p>At those times, I often tried to end the existence I detested, and it took constant vigilance to prevent me from committing some dreadful act of violence. Yet one duty remained, the memory of which ultimately triumphed over my selfish despair. I had to return to Geneva without delay, to watch over the lives of those I loved so dearly and to lie in wait for the murderer, so that if any chance led me to his hiding place, or if he dared to confront me again, I could, with unerring aim, end the existence of the monstrous being I had given the illusion of a soul that was even more monstrous.</p>\n<p>My father wanted to delay our departure, fearing I could not withstand the rigors of travel, for I was a mere wreck—the shadow of a human being. My strength was gone. I was little more than a skeleton, and fever preyed on my frail body day and night. Still, as I urged our departure from Ireland with such anxiety and urgency, my father decided it was best to comply. We booked passage on a ship bound for Havre-de-Grace and set sail with a favorable wind from the shores of Ireland.</p>\n<p>It was midnight. I lay on the deck, watching the stars and listening to the waves crashing against the ship. I welcomed the darkness that separated me from Ireland, and my heart raced with feverish joy at the thought that I would soon see Geneva. The past felt like a dreadful dream; yet the ship I was on, the wind that carried me away from the hated shores of Ireland, and the sea surrounding me made it painfully clear that I was not deceived by any vision and that Clerval, my friend and closest companion, had fallen victim to me and the monster of my own making.</p>\n<p>I replayed my entire life in my mind: my quiet happiness living with my family in Geneva, my mother’s death, and my departure for Ingolstadt. I shuddered at the crazy enthusiasm that drove me to create my hideous enemy, and I recalled the night he first came to life. I couldn’t continue that train of thought; countless feelings overwhelmed me, and I wept bitterly. Ever since my recovery from the fever, I had taken a small dose of laudanum each night, for it was the only way I could get the rest necessary to sustain my life. Burdened by the memories of my misfortunes, I now swallowed double my usual amount and soon fell into a deep sleep.</p>\n<p>But sleep did not bring me relief from my thoughts and misery; my dreams were filled with terrifying visions. Towards morning, I experienced a kind of nightmare; I felt the fiend’s grip on my neck and could</p>",

      "original": "<div class=\"chapter\" id=\"pgepubid00028\"> <h2><a id=\"chap22\">Chapter 22</a></h2><a id=\"chap22\"> <p> The voyage came to an end. We landed, and proceeded to Paris. I soon found that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I could continue my journey. My father’s care and attentions were indefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill. He wished me to seek amusement in society. I abhorred the face of man. Oh, not abhorred! They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt attracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an angelic nature and celestial mechanism. But I felt that I had no right to share their intercourse. I had unchained an enemy among them whose joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans. How they would, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world, did they know my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me! </p>\n<p> My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by various arguments to banish my despair. Sometimes he thought that I felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride. </p>\n<p> “Alas! My father,” said I, “how little do you know me. Human beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such a wretch as I felt pride. Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent as I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause of this—I murdered her. William, Justine, and Henry—they all died by my hands.” </p>\n<p> My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same assertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an explanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of delirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in my convalescence. I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence concerning the wretch I had created. I had a persuasion that I should be supposed mad, and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue. But, besides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of his breast. I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was silent when I would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret. Yet, still, words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably from me. I could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part relieved the burden of my mysterious woe. </p>\n<p> Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder, “My dearest Victor, what infatuation is this? My dear son, I entreat you never to make such an assertion again.” </p>\n<p> “I am not mad,” I cried energetically; “the sun and the heavens, who have viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth. I am the assassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations. A thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have saved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not sacrifice the whole human race.” </p>\n<p> The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were deranged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and endeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts. He wished as much as possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in Ireland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my misfortunes. </p>\n<p> As time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my heart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own crimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them. By the utmost self-violence I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world, and my manners were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey to the sea of ice. </p>\n<p> A few days before we left Paris on our way to Switzerland, I received the following letter from Elizabeth: </p> <p class=\"letter\"> “My dear Friend, </p>\n<p> “It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle dated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and I may hope to see you in less than a fortnight. My poor cousin, how much you must have suffered! I expect to see you looking even more ill than when you quitted Geneva. This winter has been passed most miserably, tortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in your countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of comfort and tranquillity. </p>\n<p> “Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable a year ago, even perhaps augmented by time. I would not disturb you at this period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you, but a conversation that I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders some explanation necessary before we meet. </p>\n<p> Explanation! You may possibly say, What can Elizabeth have to explain? If you really say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied. But you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yet be pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being the case, I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I have often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin. </p>\n<p> “You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of your parents ever since our infancy. We were told this when young, and taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take place. We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I believe, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older. But as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each other without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be our case? Tell me, dearest Victor. Answer me, I conjure you by our mutual happiness, with simple truth—Do you not love another? </p>\n<p> “You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at Ingolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last autumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every creature, I could not help supposing that you might regret our connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of your parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations. But this is false reasoning. I confess to you, my friend, that I love you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant friend and companion. But it is your happiness I desire as well as my own when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice. Even now I weep to think that, borne down as you are by the cruellest misfortunes, you may stifle, by the word <i>honour</i>, all hope of that love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself. I, who have so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes. Ah! Victor, be assured that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be made miserable by this supposition. Be happy, my friend; and if you obey me in this one request, remain satisfied that nothing on earth will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity. </p>\n<p> “Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow, or the next day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain. My uncle will send me news of your health, and if I see but one smile on your lips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, I shall need no other happiness. </p> <p class=\"right\"> “Elizabeth Lavenza. </p> <p class=\"noindent\"> “Geneva, May 18th, 17—”<br> </p>\n<p> This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat of the fiend—“<i>I will be with you on your wedding-night!</i>” Such was my sentence, and on that night would the dæmon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings. On that night he had determined to consummate his crimes by my death. Well, be it so; a deadly struggle would then assuredly take place, in which if he were victorious I should be at peace and his power over me be at an end. If he were vanquished, I should be a free man. Alas! What freedom? Such as the peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his cottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless, penniless, and alone, but free. Such would be my liberty except that in my Elizabeth I possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of remorse and guilt which would pursue me until death. </p>\n<p> Sweet and beloved Elizabeth! I read and reread her letter, and some softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal dreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the angel’s arm bared to drive me from all hope. Yet I would die to make her happy. If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet, again, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate. My destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner, but if my torturer should suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he would surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge. He had vowed <i>to be with me on my wedding-night</i>, yet he did not consider that threat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that he was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately after the enunciation of his threats. I resolved, therefore, that if my immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my father’s happiness, my adversary’s designs against my life should not retard it a single hour. </p>\n<p> In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth. My letter was calm and affectionate. “I fear, my beloved girl,” I said, “little happiness remains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred in you. Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my life and my endeavours for contentment. I have one secret, Elizabeth, a dreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with horror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only wonder that I survive what I have endured. I will confide this tale of misery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place, for, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us. But until then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it. This I most earnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.” </p>\n<p> In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth’s letter we returned to Geneva. The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears were in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. I saw a change in her also. She was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly vivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and soft looks of compassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as I was. </p>\n<p> The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure. Memory brought madness with it, and when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity possessed me; sometimes I was furious and burnt with rage, sometimes low and despondent. I neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless, bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me. </p>\n<p> Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human feelings when sunk in torpor. She wept with me and for me. When reason returned, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with resignation. Ah! It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the guilty there is no peace. The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief. </p>\n<p> Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with Elizabeth. I remained silent. </p>\n<p> “Have you, then, some other attachment?” </p>\n<p> “None on earth. I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union with delight. Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate myself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin.” </p>\n<p> “My dear Victor, do not speak thus. Heavy misfortunes have befallen us, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love for those whom we have lost to those who yet live. Our circle will be small but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune. And when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of care will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly deprived.” </p>\n<p> Such were the lessons of my father. But to me the remembrance of the threat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had yet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as invincible, and that when he had pronounced the words “<i>I shall be with you on your wedding-night</i>,” I should regard the threatened fate as unavoidable. But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were balanced with it, and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful countenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the ceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined, the seal to my fate. </p>\n<p> Great God! If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish intention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself for ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage. But, as if possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real intentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I hastened that of a far dearer victim. </p>\n<p> As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me. But I concealed my feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the countenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer eye of Elizabeth. She looked forward to our union with placid contentment, not unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed, that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret. </p>\n<p> Preparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were received, and all wore a smiling appearance. I shut up, as well as I could, in my own heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness into the plans of my father, although they might only serve as the decorations of my tragedy. Through my father’s exertions a part of the inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian government. A small possession on the shores of Como belonged to her. It was agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa Lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake near which it stood. </p>\n<p> In the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the fiend should openly attack me. I carried pistols and a dagger constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity. Indeed, as the period approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed for its solemnisation drew nearer and I heard it continually spoken of as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent. </p>\n<p> Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to calm her mind. But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my destiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her; and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had promised to reveal to her on the following day. My father was in the meantime overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only recognised in the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride. </p>\n<p> After the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my father’s, but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our journey by water, sleeping that night at Evian and continuing our voyage on the following day. The day was fair, the wind favourable; all smiled on our nuptial embarkation. </p>\n<p> Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the feeling of happiness. We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the beauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw Mont Salêve, the pleasant banks of Montalègre, and at a distance, surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc, and the assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it. </p>\n<p> I took the hand of Elizabeth. “You are sorrowful, my love. Ah! If you knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this one day at least permits me to enjoy.” </p>\n<p> “Be happy, my dear Victor,” replied Elizabeth; “there is, I hope, nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not painted in my face, my heart is contented. Something whispers to me not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I will not listen to such a sinister voice. Observe how fast we move along and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise above the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still more interesting. Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in the clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom. What a divine day! How happy and serene all nature appears!” </p>\n<p> Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all reflection upon melancholy subjects. But her temper was fluctuating; joy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place to distraction and reverie. </p>\n<p> The sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the lower hills. The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary. The spire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung. </p>\n<p> The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity, sank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the shore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and hay. The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched the shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp me and cling to me for ever. </p> </a></div>",
      "modern": "<p>Chapter 22</p>\n<p>The voyage came to an end. We landed and made our way to Paris. I soon realized that I had pushed myself too far and needed to rest before continuing my journey. My father’s care and attentions were tireless, but he didn’t understand the source of my suffering and sought misguided ways to remedy my unhealable pain. He wanted me to find enjoyment in society. But I couldn’t stand the sight of people. Oh, not that I hated them! They were my brothers and sisters, my fellow beings, and I felt drawn even to the most repulsive among them, as if they were angelic creatures. Yet I knew I didn’t deserve to share their company. I had unleashed an enemy among them, one who delighted in spilling their blood and relishing their cries. How they would all abhor me and drive me from the world if they knew of my unholy deeds and the crimes that stemmed from me! Eventually, my father gave in to my desire to avoid society and tried various arguments to lift my despair. Sometimes he thought I was deeply affected by the shame of being accused of murder, and he tried to convince me of the futility of pride.</p>\n<p>“Alas! My father,” I said, “how little you know me. Human beings and their feelings would indeed be diminished if someone as wretched as I felt pride. Justine, poor, unhappy Justine, was as innocent as I, and she faced the same accusation; she died for it, and I am the cause—I murdered her. William, Justine, and Henry—they all perished by my actions.” My father had often heard me make this claim during my imprisonment; when I accused myself, he sometimes seemed to seek an explanation, while at other times he regarded it as a product of delirium, thinking that during my illness, some idea had taken root in my imagination, a memory that lingered into my recovery. I avoided giving explanations and remained silent about the wretch I had created. I felt certain I would be considered mad, and this alone would forever silence me. Besides, I couldn’t bring myself to reveal a secret that would fill my listener with dread and bring fear and unnatural horror into their heart. Therefore, I suppressed my desperate need for sympathy and stayed quiet when I would have given anything to share my fatal secret. Still, words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably from me. I offered no explanation for them, but their truth somewhat eased the burden of my mysterious sorrow.</p>\n<p>On this occasion, my father said, with an expression of boundless wonder, “My dearest Victor, what infatuation is this? My dear son, I beg you never to make such an assertion again.”</p>\n<p>“I am not mad,” I cried passionately; “the sun and the heavens, which have witnessed my deeds, can testify to my truth. I am the murderer of those innocent victims; their deaths are on my conscience. A thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to save their lives; but I could not, my father, I truly could not sacrifice the entire human race.”</p>\n<p>The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my thoughts were deranged, and he immediately changed the subject to steer my mind elsewhere. He wanted to erase the memory of the events in Ireland as much as possible and never mentioned them or allowed me to speak of my misfortunes. As time passed, I became calmer; misery resided in my heart, but I no longer spoke incoherently about my own crimes; my awareness of them was enough. With great self-restraint, I stifled the urgent voice of despair that sometimes yearned to declare itself to the world, and my demeanor was calmer and more composed than it had been since my journey to the sea of ice.</p>\n<p>A few days before we left Paris for Switzerland, I received the following letter from Elizabeth:</p>\n<p>“My dear Friend,</p>\n<p>It brought me immense joy to receive a letter from my uncle dated in Paris; you are no longer at such a great distance, and I hope to see you in less than a fortnight. My poor cousin, how much you must have suffered! I expect to see you looking even worse than when you left Geneva. This winter has been horrible for me, tormented by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in your face and to find that your heart is not entirely devoid of comfort and tranquility.</p>\n<p>Yet I fear that the same feelings exist now that made you so miserable a year ago, perhaps even intensified by time. I wouldn’t want to disturb you during this period when so many misfortunes burden you, but a conversation I had with my uncle before his departure makes some explanation necessary before we meet. Explanation! You might wonder, what could Elizabeth possibly have to explain? If you truly think this, then my questions are answered, and all my doubts are resolved. But you are far from me, and it’s possible you might dread yet be pleased by this explanation; if that’s the case, I cannot postpone writing what I’ve often wished to express to you during your absence but never had the courage to begin.</p>\n<p>You know, Victor, that our union has been the cherished plan of your parents since our childhood. We were told this when we were young and taught to look forward to it as something certain to happen. We were affectionate playmates in our childhood, and I believe we are dear and valued friends as we grew older. But just as siblings can feel a lively affection toward each other without desiring a more intimate union, could our case not be the same? Tell me, dearest Victor. Answer me, I implore you for our mutual happiness, with simple honesty—do you not love another?</p>\n<p>You have traveled; you have spent several years of your life in Ingolstadt; and I must confess, my friend, that when I saw you last autumn, so unhappy and fleeing into solitude from the company of every creature, I couldn’t help but think that you might regret our connection and feel bound by honor to fulfill your parents’ wishes, even though they went against your inclinations. But this is false reasoning. I confess to you, my friend, that I love you, and in my airy dreams of the future, you have been my constant friend and companion. But your happiness is as dear to me as my own, and I declare to you that our marriage would make me eternally miserable unless it were your own free choice. Even now, I weep to think that, weighed down by the cruelest misfortunes, you might suppress all hope of that love and happiness which alone could restore you to yourself. I, who have such selfless affection for you, could increase your miseries tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes. Ah! Victor, rest assured that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you to be made miserable by this assumption. Be happy, my friend; and if you heed this one request, be satisfied that nothing on earth can disturb my tranquility.</p>\n<p>Do not let this letter distress you; do not answer tomorrow, or the next day, or even until you come, if it will cause you pain. My uncle will inform me of your health, and if I see just one smile on your lips when we meet, caused by this or any other effort of mine, I will need no other happiness.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth Lavenza.</p>\n<p>Geneva, May 18th, 17—”</p>\n<p>This letter revived a memory I had previously forgotten, the monster’s threat—“I will be with you on your wedding night!” That was my sentence, and on that night, the demon would employ every trick to destroy me and rip me from the glimpse of happiness that might partially console my suffering. On that night, he intended to complete his crimes with my death. So be it; a deadly struggle would certainly take place, in which, if he were victorious, I would find peace, and his hold on me would end. If he were defeated, I would be free. Alas! What freedom? Like that of a peasant who has witnessed his family slaughtered before his eyes, his home burned, his land ravaged, and who is left homeless, penniless, and alone—but free. Such would be my liberty, except that in my Elizabeth, I possessed a treasure, alas, overshadowed by the horrors of remorse and guilt that would pursue me until death. Sweet and beloved Elizabeth! I read and reread her letter, and some softened feelings crept into my heart and dared to whisper heavenly dreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the angel’s arm was bare to drive me from all hope. Yet I would die to make her happy. If the monster carried out his threat, death was inevitable; yet again, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate. My destruction might indeed come a few months sooner, but if my tormentor suspected that I postponed it due to his threats, he would surely find other, perhaps even more dreadful means of revenge. He had vowed to be with me on my wedding night, yet he didn’t consider that threat binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that he was not yet satisfied with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately after issuing his threats.</p>\n<p>I resolved, therefore, that if marrying my cousin would contribute to either her happiness or my father’s, my enemy’s plans against my life would not delay it by a single hour. In this frame of mind, I wrote to Elizabeth. My letter was calm and affectionate.</p>\n<p>“I fear, my beloved girl,” I said, “that little happiness remains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centered in you. Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I dedicate my life and my efforts for contentment. I have one secret, Elizabeth, a dreadful one; when I reveal it to you, it will chill you with horror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only wonder how I survive what I have endured. I will share this tale of misery and terror with you the day after our marriage, for, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect trust between us. But until then, I implore you, do not mention or allude to it. This I earnestly request, and I know you will comply.”</p>\n<p>About a week after receiving Elizabeth’s letter, we returned to Geneva. The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears filled her eyes as she looked at my worn frame and feverish cheeks. I noticed a change in her as well. She had become thinner and lost much of the heavenly vivacity that had previously enchanted me; but her gentleness and soft looks of compassion made her a more suitable companion for someone as shattered and miserable as I was.</p>\n<p>The tranquility I now felt did not last. Memory brought madness with it, and when I thought of what had happened, a real insanity took hold of me; sometimes I was furious and burned with rage, other times I was low and despondent. I neither spoke nor looked at anyone but sat motionless, overwhelmed by the multitude of miseries that consumed me. Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice would soothe me when I was filled with passion and inspire me with human feelings when I was in a stupor. She wept with me and for me. When reason returned, she would argue with me and try to inspire me with acceptance. Ah! It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the guilty, there is no peace. The agonies of remorse poison the occasional luxury found in indulging in deep grief.</p>\n<p>Soon after my arrival, my father spoke of my immediate marriage to Elizabeth. I remained silent.</p>\n<p>“Do you have some other attachment?”</p>\n<p>“None on earth. I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union with joy. Let the day be set; and on that day, I will dedicate myself, in life or death, to my cousin’s happiness.”</p>\n<p>“My dear Victor, do not speak like that. Heavy misfortunes have befallen us, but let us cling closer to what remains and transfer our love for those we have lost to those who still live. Our circle will be small but tightly bound by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune. And when time has softened your despair, new and cherished objects of care will arise to replace those we have been so cruelly deprived of.”</p>\n<p>Such were my father’s lessons. But to me, the memory of the threat returned; nor can you wonder that, as powerful as the fiend had been in his bloody deeds, I should regard him as nearly invincible, and that when he pronounced, “I shall be with you on your wedding night,” I should see the threatened fate as unavoidable. But death was no evil to me if it meant losing Elizabeth, and so, with a contented and even cheerful demeanor, I agreed with my father that if my cousin consented, the ceremony would take place in ten days, thus sealing my fate.</p>\n<p>Great God! If for just one instant I had considered what might be the hellish intention of my fiendish enemy, I would rather have banished myself forever from my homeland and wandered the earth as a friendless outcast than have consented to this miserable marriage. But, as if possessed of magical powers, the monster had blinded me to his true intentions; and while I thought I had prepared only for my own death, I hastened the demise of a far dearer victim.</p>\n<p>As the date set for our marriage approached, whether from cowardice or a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink. But I concealed my feelings behind an appearance of happiness that brought smiles and joy to my father’s face, though it hardly fooled the ever-watchful and perceptive eyes of Elizabeth. She looked forward to our union with serene contentment, mixed with a bit of fear, which past misfortunes had instilled, that what now seemed certain and tangible happiness might soon evaporate into a fleeting dream, leaving only deep and everlasting regret.</p>\n<p>Preparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were received, and everything appeared cheerful. I tried to lock away the anxiety that gnawed at me and engaged earnestly in my father’s plans, even though they might only serve as the decorations for my tragedy. Through my father’s efforts, a portion of Elizabeth’s inheritance had been restored to her by the Austrian government. A small property on the shores of Lake Como belonged to her. It was agreed that immediately after our wedding, we would go to Villa Lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake. In the meantime, I took every precaution to protect myself in case the fiend chose to attack me openly. I carried pistols and a dagger with me at all times and was always on guard to prevent any trickery, which brought me a greater sense of calm. Indeed, as the date approached, the threat seemed more like a delusion, unworthy of disturbing my peace, while the happiness I anticipated from marriage appeared increasingly certain as the day drew near and I heard it continually discussed as something that no accident could possibly prevent.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth seemed happy; my calm demeanor helped ease her mind. But on the day that was to fulfill my wishes and destiny, she was melancholy, and a sense of impending doom enveloped her; perhaps she also thought of the dreadful secret I had promised to reveal to her the following day. My father was overjoyed, and in the flurry of preparation, he only perceived Elizabeth’s sadness as the nerves of a bride.</p>\n<p>After the ceremony, a large gathering assembled at my father’s house, but it was decided that Elizabeth and I would begin our journey by water, spending that night at Evian and continuing our voyage the next day. The weather was fair, the wind favorable; everything smiled upon our wedding embarkation. Those were the last moments of my life during which I felt happiness.</p>\n<p>We passed swiftly along; the sun was hot, but we were sheltered from its rays by a canopy as we enjoyed the beauty of the scene, sometimes along one side of the lake, where we saw Mont Salêve, the pleasant banks of Montalègre, and in the distance, dominating all, the magnificent Mont Blanc, surrounded by a group of snowy mountains that vainly tried to rival it; sometimes along the opposite shore, we glimpsed the mighty Jura, presenting its dark side to those who would leave their native land, and forming an almost insurmountable barrier to any invader wishing to conquer it.</p>\n<p>I took Elizabeth’s hand. “You seem sad, my love. Ah! If you knew what I’ve suffered and what I may still endure, you would strive to let me experience the peace and freedom from despair that this one day at least allows me to enjoy.”</p>\n<p>“Be happy, my dear Victor,” replied Elizabeth; “I hope there’s nothing to distress you; and rest assured that if joy isn’t vividly painted on my face, my heart is content. Something whispers to me not to rely too much on the future that lies before us, but I will not heed such an ominous voice. Look how fast we glide along and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise above Mont Blanc’s dome, make this beautiful scene even more captivating. Also, observe the countless fish swimming in the clear waters, where we can see every pebble at the bottom. What a divine day! How happy and serene all nature appears!”</p>\n<p>Thus, Elizabeth tried to divert her thoughts and mine from all reflections on sorrowful subjects. But her mood fluctuated; joy sparkled in her eyes for a few moments, but it was quickly replaced by distraction and reverie. The sun sank lower in the sky; we passed the Drance River and marked its path through the chasms of the higher and the valleys of the lower hills. The Alps drew closer to the lake, and we neared the amphitheater of mountains that formed its eastern boundary. The spire of Evian glimmered under the woods that surrounded it, and the range of mountains above, each towering over the last. The wind, which had carried us along so swiftly, calmed at sunset to a gentle breeze; the soft air barely ruffled the water and created a pleasant rustle among the trees as we approached the shore, wafting the most delightful scent of flowers and hay toward us.</p>\n<p>The sun dipped below the horizon as we landed, and as I touched the shore, I felt those cares and fears revive, which would soon grasp me and cling to me forever.</p>",

      "original": "<div class=\"chapter\" id=\"pgepubid00029\"> <h2><a id=\"chap23\">Chapter 23</a></h2><a id=\"chap23\"> <p> It was eight o’clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn and contemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured in darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines. </p>\n<p> The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence in the west. The moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was beginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves that were beginning to rise. Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended. </p>\n<p> I had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind. I was anxious and watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in my bosom; every sound terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell my life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that of my adversary was extinguished. </p>\n<p> Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence, but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and trembling, she asked, “What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor? What is it you fear?” </p>\n<p> “Oh! Peace, peace, my love,” replied I; “this night, and all will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.” </p>\n<p> I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how fearful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife, and I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her until I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy. </p>\n<p> She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to my adversary. But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the execution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful scream. It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired. As I heard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. This state lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed into the room. </p>\n<p> Great God! Why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate the destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth? She was there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair. Everywhere I turn I see the same figure—her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung by the murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold this and live? Alas! Life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated. For a moment only did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground. </p>\n<p> When I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their countenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of others appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. I escaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. She had been moved from the posture in which I had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have supposed her asleep. I rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, but the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I now held in my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished. The murderous mark of the fiend’s grasp was on her neck, and the breath had ceased to issue from her lips. </p>\n<p> While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up. The windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber. The shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be described, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred. A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed towards the window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me, leaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning, plunged into the lake. </p>\n<p> The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to the spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with boats; nets were cast, but in vain. After passing several hours, we returned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a form conjured up by my fancy. After having landed, they proceeded to search the country, parties going in different directions among the woods and vines. </p>\n<p> I attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the house, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken man, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my eyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever. In this state I was carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had happened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that I had lost. </p>\n<p> After an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room where the corpse of my beloved lay. There were women weeping around; I hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no distinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their cause. I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death of William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly of my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his feet. This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action. I started up and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed. </p>\n<p> There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents. However, it was hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired men to row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from mental torment in bodily exercise. But the overflowing misery I now felt, and the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any exertion. I threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way to every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I saw scenes which were familiar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the day before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection. Tears streamed from my eyes. The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had then been observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change. The sun might shine or the clouds might lower, but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. A fiend had snatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever been so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of man. </p>\n<p> But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event? Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their <i>acme</i>, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know that, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate. My own strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few words, what remains of my hideous narration. </p>\n<p> I arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk under the tidings that I bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable old man! His eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their delight—his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with all that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain. Cursed, cursed be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste in wretchedness! He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to rise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms. </p>\n<p> What then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me. Sometimes, indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales with the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a dungeon. Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my prison. For they had called me mad, and during many months, as I understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation. </p>\n<p> Liberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I awakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge. As the memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their cause—the monster whom I had created, the miserable dæmon whom I had sent abroad into the world for my destruction. I was possessed by a maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed that I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge on his cursed head. </p>\n<p> Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about a month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town and told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew the destroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer. </p>\n<p> The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness. “Be assured, sir,” said he, “no pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to discover the villain.” </p>\n<p> “I thank you,” replied I; “listen, therefore, to the deposition that I have to make. It is indeed a tale so strange that I should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth which, however wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.” My manner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in my own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life. I now related my history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation. </p>\n<p> The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued he became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with horror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted on his countenance. </p>\n<p> When I had concluded my narration, I said, “This is the being whom I accuse and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your whole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those functions on this occasion.” </p>\n<p> This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own auditor. He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity returned. He, however, answered mildly, “I would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. Who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where no man would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he has wandered or what region he may now inhabit.” </p>\n<p> “I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and if he has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois and destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts; you do not credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert.” </p>\n<p> As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated. “You are mistaken,” said he. “I will exert myself, and if it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes. But I fear, from what you have yourself described to be his properties, that this will prove impracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should make up your mind to disappointment.” </p>\n<p> “That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail. My revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul. My rage is unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned loose upon society, still exists. You refuse my just demand; I have but one resource, and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to his destruction.” </p>\n<p> I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy in my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed. But to a Genevan magistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of devotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of madness. He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium. </p>\n<p> “Man,” I cried, “how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom! Cease; you know not what it is you say.” </p>\n<p> I broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on some other mode of action. </p> </a></div>",
      "modern": "<p>Chapter 23</p>\n<p>We landed at eight o'clock and took a short walk along the shore, enjoying the fleeting light. Afterward, we returned to the inn and admired the beautiful scene of water, woods, and mountains, now shrouded in darkness, yet still revealing their dark outlines. The wind, which had calmed in the south, suddenly picked up violently from the west. The moon had reached its peak in the sky and was starting to descend; clouds raced across it faster than a vulture’s flight, dimming its light, while the lake mirrored the chaotic sky, made livelier by the restless waves beginning to rise.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, a heavy rainstorm broke out. I had felt calm throughout the day, but as night fell and obscured the shapes of familiar objects, a thousand fears flooded my mind. I became anxious and vigilant, my right hand clutching a pistol hidden in my coat. Every sound sent chills through me, but I resolved to fight fiercely and not back down until either my life or that of my enemy was extinguished.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth noticed my agitation, observing me in timid silence for a while, but something in my gaze conveyed terror to her. Trembling, she asked, “What’s troubling you, my dear Victor? What do you fear?”</p>\n<p>“Oh! Peace, peace, my love,” I replied. “Tonight will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.”</p>\n<p>I spent an hour in this state of mind when suddenly it hit me how terrifying the fight I anticipated would be for my wife. I urgently urged her to retire, promising I wouldn’t join her until I had some understanding of my enemy's situation. After she left, I paced the halls of the house, inspecting every corner that might offer a hiding place for my adversary. I found no trace of him and began to think that perhaps some fortunate event had intervened to prevent him from carrying out his threats when, out of nowhere, I heard a shrill and horrifying scream.</p>\n<p>It came from the room where Elizabeth had gone. Upon hearing it, the full truth crashed over me; my arms fell limp, and every muscle in my body froze. I felt the blood trickling in my veins and tingling at the tips of my fingers. This moment lasted only an instant, but the scream echoed again, and I burst into the room.</p>\n<p>Great God! Why did I not die then? Why am I here to recount the destruction of the best hope and purest soul on earth? There she lay, lifeless and still, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down, her pale and contorted features half-hidden by her hair. Everywhere I looked, I saw the same figure—her bloodless arms and relaxed form laid out by the murderer on her bridal bier. How could I see this and live? Alas! Life is stubborn and clings hardest where it is most despised. For just a moment, I lost consciousness and collapsed on the ground.</p>\n<p>When I came to, I found myself surrounded by the inn’s guests; their faces reflected breathless terror, but their horror seemed trivial, a mere shadow of the anguish that engulfed me. I broke free from them and rushed back to the room where Elizabeth's body lay, my love, my wife, who had been so vibrant, so dear, so deserving. They had moved her from the position in which I first saw her, and now, with her head resting on her arm and a handkerchief draped over her face and neck, I could almost believe she was asleep. I lunged towards her and embraced her passionately, but the coldness of her limbs and the deadly stillness told me that what I held was no longer the Elizabeth I had loved and cherished. The murderous mark of the fiend’s grip was on her neck, and her breath had ceased to flow from her lips.</p>\n<p>As I hovered over her in despair, I glanced up. The room's windows had been darkened, but I felt a wave of panic at the sight of the pale yellow light of the moon illuminating the chamber. The shutters had been thrown open, and with a horror I cannot describe, I saw a figure at the open window, the most hideous and loathsome sight. A grin twisted the monster's face; he seemed to mock me, his fiendish finger pointed at the corpse of my wife. I rushed to the window, drawing the pistol from my coat and firing, but he dodged me, leaping from his place and running like lightning into the lake.</p>\n<p>The sound of the gun brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to the spot where he had vanished, and we followed the trail with boats; nets were cast, but to no avail. After several hours, we returned empty-handed, most of my companions convinced it was just a figment of my imagination. After landing, they went off to search the surrounding countryside, splitting into groups among the woods and vines. I tried to join them, moving a short distance from the house, but my head spun, my steps faltered like those of a drunkard, and I finally collapsed in utter exhaustion. A film covered my eyes, and my skin felt parched with fever.</p>\n<p>In this state, I was carried back and laid on a bed, barely aware of what had happened; my eyes wandered around the room as if searching for something I had lost. After a while, I got up and, almost instinctively, crawled into the room where my beloved lay. Women wept around her; I leaned over her and joined my tears with theirs. Throughout this time, no clear thoughts came to me, but my mind wandered through various topics, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their causes. I was lost in a fog of wonder and horror. The death of William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and now my wife; even at that moment, I didn’t know if my only remaining friends were safe from the monster’s wrath. My father might be suffering under his grip, and Ernest could be dead at his feet. This thought made me shudder and brought me back to reality. I jumped up and resolved to return to Geneva as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>There were no horses available, so I had to go back by the lake, but the wind was against me, and the rain fell in torrents. However, it was still early morning, and I could reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired men to row and took an oar myself, as I had always found relief from mental anguish in physical exertion. But the overwhelming misery I felt and the intensity of my agitation rendered me incapable of any effort. I dropped the oar, leaned my head on my hands, and surrendered to every dark thought that arose.</p>\n<p>If I looked up, I saw scenes familiar from my happier days, places I had visited just the day before with the woman who was now nothing but a shadow and a memory. Tears streamed down my face. The rain had stopped for a moment, and I saw fish playing in the water as they had a few hours earlier; just hours before, Elizabeth had watched them. Nothing is more painful to the human mind than a sudden and drastic change. The sun could shine or the clouds could gather, but nothing appeared to me as it had the day before. A monster had stolen every hope of future happiness from me; no one had ever been as miserable as I was; such a dreadful event is unmatched in human history.</p>\n<p>But why should I dwell on the events that followed this final overwhelming moment? My life has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their peak, and what I must now recount will only bore you. Know that, one by one, my friends were taken from me; I was left desolate. My strength was spent, and I must now summarize the remaining parts of my ghastly story.</p>\n<p>I arrived in Geneva. My father and Ernest were still alive, but the former was devastated by the news I brought. I can see him now, the excellent and venerable old man! His eyes wandered in emptiness, for they had lost their light and joy—his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he adored with all the affection of a man in the twilight of life, clinging more desperately to those he had left. Cursed be the fiend that brought misery upon his grey hairs and condemned him to suffer in wretchedness! He could not endure the horrors that surrounded him; the very springs of life broke down; he could not rise from his bed, and in a few days, he died in my arms.</p>\n<p>What then became of me? I don’t know; I lost all sensation, and chains and darkness were the only things that weighed upon me. Sometimes, I indeed dreamed I wandered through flowery meadows and lovely valleys with my childhood friends, but I would wake to find myself in a dungeon. Melancholy followed, but gradually I gained a clearer understanding of my miseries and circumstances and was finally released from my prison. They had deemed me mad, and for many months, as I learned, a solitary cell had been my home.</p>\n<p>Yet, liberty had become a meaningless gift; as I regained my sanity, I also awakened to thoughts of revenge. As the memories of my past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their cause—the creature I had created, the miserable being I had unleashed into the world for my own destruction. I was consumed by a maddening rage when I thought of him, yearning and fervently praying for the chance to take him in my grasp and exact a great and significant revenge on his cursed head.</p>\n<p>My hatred did not remain confined to mere wishes; I started to think of the best ways to capture him. About a month after my release, I went to a criminal judge in town and told him that I had an accusation to make: I knew who had destroyed my family, and I needed him to use all his authority to apprehend the murderer. The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness.</p>\n<p>“Be assured, sir,” he said, “no effort will be spared on my part to discover the villain.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you,” I replied. “Now, listen to the story I must share. It is so strange that I fear you won’t believe it unless you sense the truth in it, which, however extraordinary, is undeniable. The tale is too coherent to be mistaken for a dream, and I have no reason to lie.”</p>\n<p>My demeanor as I spoke was intense but calm; I had made a resolution in my heart to pursue my destroyer to the death, and this purpose quieted my agony and reconciled me to life for a time. I briefly recounted my history with firmness and precision, marking the dates accurately and never veering into invective or exclamation.</p>\n<p>At first, the magistrate seemed completely incredulous, but as I continued, he grew more attentive and interested. I saw him shudder with horror at times; at others, genuine surprise, untainted by disbelief, was clear on his face. When I finished my story, I said, “This is the being I accuse, and for whose capture and punishment I call upon you to use all your power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that your feelings as a man will compel you to carry out this responsibility.”</p>\n<p>This address caused a significant change in the magistrate's expression. He had listened to my story with the half-belief often given to tales of spirits and the supernatural; but when called upon to act officially, all his disbelief came rushing back. He replied gently, “I would gladly assist you in your pursuit, but the creature you describe seems to possess abilities that would defy all my efforts. Who can track down a being that can traverse the sea of ice and dwell in caves and dens where no man would dare to intrude? Furthermore, several months have passed since his crimes, and no one can guess where he has wandered or what region he may inhabit now.”</p>\n<p>“I have no doubt that he lurks near my home, and if he has indeed sought refuge in the Alps, he can be hunted like a chamois and destroyed as a beast of prey. But I sense your thoughts; you do not believe my story and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment he deserves.”</p>\n<p>As I spoke, rage sparked in my eyes, intimidating the magistrate. “You are mistaken,” he said. “I will do my utmost, and if it is within my power to seize the monster, rest assured he will face punishment commensurate with his crimes. But I fear, based on your own description of his abilities, that this will prove impossible; consequently, while every appropriate measure will be taken, you should prepare yourself for disappointment.”</p>\n<p>“That cannot be! All I can say will amount to little. My revenge is of no importance to you; yet, while I acknowledge it as a vice, I admit it is the all-consuming passion of my soul. My rage is indescribable when I think that the murderer I unleashed upon society still lives. You refuse my rightful demand; I have but one option left, and I devote myself, whether in life or death, to his destruction.”</p>\n<p>I trembled with overwhelming agitation as I spoke; there was a frenzy in my demeanor and something, I am sure, of that fierce determination that martyrs of old are said to have possessed. But to a Genevan magistrate, whose mind was preoccupied with far different ideas than those of devotion and heroism, this elevation of spirit appeared close to madness. He tried to calm me as a nurse would soothe a child and dismissed my tale as the effects of delirium.</p>\n<p>“Man,” I cried, “how ignorant you are in your pride of wisdom! Stop; you don’t know what you’re saying.” I stormed out of the house, angry and disturbed, retreating to contemplate another course of action.</p>",

      "original": "<div class=\"chapter\" id=\"pgepubid00030\"> <h2><a id=\"chap24\">Chapter 24</a></h2><a id=\"chap24\"> <p> My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was swallowed up and lost. I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone endowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise delirium or death would have been my portion. </p>\n<p> My first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when I was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became hateful. I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels which had belonged to my mother, and departed. </p>\n<p> And now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life. I have traversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet. How I have lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon the sandy plain and prayed for death. But revenge kept me alive; I dared not die and leave my adversary in being. </p>\n<p> When I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy. But my plan was unsettled, and I wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain what path I should pursue. As night approached I found myself at the entrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father reposed. I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their graves. Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested observer. The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to cast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the mourner. </p>\n<p> The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to rage and despair. They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived, and to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence. I knelt on the grass and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, “By the sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the spirits that preside over thee, to pursue the dæmon who caused this misery, until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict. For this purpose I will preserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun and tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my eyes for ever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering ministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work. Let the cursed and hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now torments me.” </p>\n<p> I had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion, but the furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked my utterance. </p>\n<p> I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish laugh. It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed it, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter. Surely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and have destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that I was reserved for vengeance. The laughter died away, when a well-known and abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an audible whisper, “I am satisfied, miserable wretch! You have determined to live, and I am satisfied.” </p>\n<p> I darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil eluded my grasp. Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than mortal speed. </p>\n<p> I pursued him, and for many months this has been my task. Guided by a slight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly. The blue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea. I took my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how. </p>\n<p> Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I have ever followed in his track. Sometimes the peasants, scared by this horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself, who feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die, left some mark to guide me. The snows descended on my head, and I saw the print of his huge step on the white plain. To you first entering on life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand what I have felt and still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue were the least pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil and carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good followed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties. Sometimes, when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me. The fare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but I will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had invoked to aid me. Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the few drops that revived me, and vanish. </p>\n<p> I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the dæmon generally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the country chiefly collected. In other places human beings were seldom seen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my path. I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers by distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed, which, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had provided me with fire and utensils for cooking. </p>\n<p> My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during sleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! Often, when most miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of happiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived of this respite, I should have sunk under my hardships. During the day I was sustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my friends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth’s voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth. Often, when wearied by a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should come and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends. What agonising fondness did I feel for them! How did I cling to their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and persuade myself that they still lived! At such moments vengeance, that burned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the destruction of the dæmon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the mechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than as the ardent desire of my soul. </p>\n<p> What his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know. Sometimes, indeed, he left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided me and instigated my fury. “My reign is not yet over”—these words were legible in one of these inscriptions—“you live, and my power is complete. Follow me; I seek the everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the misery of cold and frost, to which I am impassive. You will find near this place, if you follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed. Come on, my enemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserable hours must you endure until that period shall arrive.” </p>\n<p> Scoffing devil! Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee, miserable fiend, to torture and death. Never will I give up my search until he or I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join my Elizabeth and my departed friends, who even now prepare for me the reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage! </p>\n<p> As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and the cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support. The peasants were shut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to seek for prey. The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be procured; and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance. </p>\n<p> The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours. One inscription that he left was in these words: “Prepare! Your toils only begin; wrap yourself in furs and provide food, for we shall soon enter upon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting hatred.” </p>\n<p> My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I resolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on Heaven to support me, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts, until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon. Oh! How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the south! Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness. The Greeks wept for joy when they beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils. I did not weep, but I knelt down and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in safety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary’s gibe, to meet and grapple with him. </p>\n<p> Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs and thus traversed the snows with inconceivable speed. I know not whether the fiend possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had daily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that when I first saw the ocean he was but one day’s journey in advance, and I hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach. With new courage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the seashore. I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the fiend and gained accurate information. A gigantic monster, they said, had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols, putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of his terrific appearance. He had carried off their store of winter food, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same night, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the ice or frozen by the eternal frosts. </p>\n<p> On hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair. He had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endless journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few of the inhabitants could long endure and which I, the native of a genial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive. Yet at the idea that the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance returned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling. After a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered round and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey. </p>\n<p> I exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of the Frozen Ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I departed from land. </p>\n<p> I cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have endured misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution burning within my heart could have enabled me to support. Immense and rugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard the thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction. But again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure. </p>\n<p> By the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that I had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction of hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of despondency and grief from my eyes. Despair had indeed almost secured her prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery. Once, after the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the summit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue, died, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain. I strained my sight to discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known form within. Oh! With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart! Warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might not intercept the view I had of the dæmon; but still my sight was dimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that oppressed me, I wept aloud. </p>\n<p> But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their dead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an hour’s rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly irksome to me, I continued my route. The sledge was still visible, nor did I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short time some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags. I indeed perceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two days’ journey, I beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within me. </p>\n<p> But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were suddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had ever done before. A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous and terrific. I pressed on, but in vain. The wind arose; the sea roared; and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound. The work was soon finished; in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and thus preparing for me a hideous death. </p>\n<p> In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and I myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when I saw your vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life. I had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded at the sight. I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, and by these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in the direction of your ship. I had determined, if you were going southwards, still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my purpose. I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue my enemy. But your direction was northwards. You took me on board when my vigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my multiplied hardships into a death which I still dread, for my task is unfulfilled. </p>\n<p> Oh! When will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the dæmon, allow me the rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live? If I do, swear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him and satisfy my vengeance in his death. And do I dare to ask of you to undertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone? No; I am not so selfish. Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear, if the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that he shall not live—swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes. He is eloquent and persuasive, and once his words had even power over my heart; but trust him not. His soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery and fiend-like malice. Hear him not; call on the names of William, Justine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor, and thrust your sword into his heart. I will hover near and direct the steel aright. </p> <p class=\"letter2\"> Walton, <i>in continuation.</i> </p> <p class=\"right\"> August 26th, 17—. </p> <p class=\"noindent\"> You have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do you not feel your blood congeal with horror, like that which even now curdles mine? Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his tale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with difficulty the words so replete with anguish. His fine and lovely eyes were now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow and quenched in infinite wretchedness. Sometimes he commanded his countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression of the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor. </p>\n<p> His tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth, yet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me, and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations, however earnest and connected. Such a monster has, then, really existence! I cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I endeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his creature’s formation, but on this point he was impenetrable. </p>\n<p> “Are you mad, my friend?” said he. “Or whither does your senseless curiosity lead you? Would you also create for yourself and the world a demoniacal enemy? Peace, peace! Learn my miseries and do not seek to increase your own.” </p>\n<p> Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history; he asked to see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places, but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held with his enemy. “Since you have preserved my narration,” said he, “I would not that a mutilated one should go down to posterity.” </p>\n<p> Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest tale that ever imagination formed. My thoughts and every feeling of my soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale and his own elevated and gentle manners have created. I wish to soothe him, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of every hope of consolation, to live? Oh, no! The only joy that he can now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and death. Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and delirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or excitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his fancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a remote world. This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth. </p>\n<p> Our conversations are not always confined to his own history and misfortunes. On every point of general literature he displays unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension. His eloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he relates a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love, without tears. What a glorious creature must he have been in the days of his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin! He seems to feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall. </p>\n<p> “When younger,” said he, “I believed myself destined for some great enterprise. My feelings are profound, but I possessed a coolness of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. This sentiment of the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed, for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that might be useful to my fellow creatures. When I reflected on the work I had completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational animal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors. But this thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now serves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my speculations and hopes are as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am chained in an eternal hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of analysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man. Even now I cannot recollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete. I trod heaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea of their effects. From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty ambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! My friend, if you had known me as I once was, you would not recognise me in this state of degradation. Despondency rarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell, never, never again to rise.” </p>\n<p> Must I then lose this admirable being? I have longed for a friend; I have sought one who would sympathise with and love me. Behold, on these desert seas I have found such a one, but I fear I have gained him only to know his value and lose him. I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea. </p>\n<p> “I thank you, Walton,” he said, “for your kind intentions towards so miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh affections, think you that any can replace those who are gone? Can any man be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another Elizabeth? Even where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence, the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our minds which hardly any later friend can obtain. They know our infantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified, are never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. A sister or a brother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early, suspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend, however strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be contemplated with suspicion. But I enjoyed friends, dear not only through habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever I am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of Clerval will be ever whispered in my ear. They are dead, and but one feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life. If I were engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive utility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it. But such is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I gave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and I may die.” </p> <p class=\"letter\"> My beloved Sister, </p> <p class=\"right\"> September 2d. </p>\n<p> I write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever doomed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that inhabit it. I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and threaten every moment to crush my vessel. The brave fellows whom I have persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid, but I have none to bestow. There is something terribly appalling in our situation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me. Yet it is terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered through me. If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause. </p>\n<p> And what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind? You will not hear of my destruction, and you will anxiously await my return. Years will pass, and you will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope. Oh! My beloved sister, the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations is, in prospect, more terrible to me than my own death. But you have a husband and lovely children; you may be happy. Heaven bless you and make you so! </p>\n<p> My unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion. He endeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession which he valued. He reminds me how often the same accidents have happened to other navigators who have attempted this sea, and in spite of myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries. Even the sailors feel the power of his eloquence; when he speaks, they no longer despair; he rouses their energies, and while they hear his voice they believe these vast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before the resolutions of man. These feelings are transitory; each day of expectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny caused by this despair. </p> <p class=\"right\"> September 5th. </p>\n<p> A scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that, although it is highly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot forbear recording it. </p>\n<p> We are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger of being crushed in their conflict. The cold is excessive, and many of my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of desolation. Frankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire still glimmers in his eyes, but he is exhausted, and when suddenly roused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent lifelessness. </p>\n<p> I mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny. This morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend—his eyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly—I was roused by half a dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin. They entered, and their leader addressed me. He told me that he and his companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation to me to make me a requisition which, in justice, I could not refuse. We were immured in ice and should probably never escape, but they feared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate and a free passage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage and lead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted this. They insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn promise that if the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my course southwards. </p>\n<p> This speech troubled me. I had not despaired, nor had I yet conceived the idea of returning if set free. Yet could I, in justice, or even in possibility, refuse this demand? I hesitated before I answered, when Frankenstein, who had at first been silent, and indeed appeared hardly to have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled, and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour. Turning towards the men, he said, </p>\n<p> “What do you mean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you, then, so easily turned from your design? Did you not call this a glorious expedition? “And wherefore was it glorious? Not because the way was smooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and terror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth and your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and these you were to brave and overcome. For this was it a glorious, for this was it an honourable undertaking. You were hereafter to be hailed as the benefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave men who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind. And now, behold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first mighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and peril; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm firesides. Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come thus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove yourselves cowards. Oh! Be men, or be more than men. Be steady to your purposes and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff as your hearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it shall not. Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace marked on your brows. Return as heroes who have fought and conquered and who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.” </p>\n<p> He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed in his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can you wonder that these men were moved? They looked at one another and were unable to reply. I spoke; I told them to retire and consider of what had been said, that I would not lead them farther north if they strenuously desired the contrary, but that I hoped that, with reflection, their courage would return. </p>\n<p> They retired and I turned towards my friend, but he was sunk in languor and almost deprived of life. </p>\n<p> How all this will terminate, I know not, but I had rather die than return shamefully, my purpose unfulfilled. Yet I fear such will be my fate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never willingly continue to endure their present hardships. </p> <p class=\"right\"> September 7th. </p>\n<p> The die is cast; I have consented to return if we are not destroyed. Thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back ignorant and disappointed. It requires more philosophy than I possess to bear this injustice with patience. </p> <p class=\"right\"> September 12th. </p>\n<p> It is past; I am returning to England. I have lost my hopes of utility and glory; I have lost my friend. But I will endeavour to detail these bitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while I am wafted towards England and towards you, I will not despond. </p>\n<p> September 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were heard at a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction. We were in the most imminent peril, but as we could only remain passive, my chief attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in such a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed. The ice cracked behind us and was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprang from the west, and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectly free. When the sailors saw this and that their return to their native country was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them, loud and long-continued. Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the cause of the tumult. “They shout,” I said, “because they will soon return to England.” </p>\n<p> “Do you, then, really return?” </p>\n<p> “Alas! Yes; I cannot withstand their demands. I cannot lead them unwillingly to danger, and I must return.” </p>\n<p> “Do so, if you will; but I will not. You may give up your purpose, but mine is assigned to me by Heaven, and I dare not. I am weak, but surely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with sufficient strength.” Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the bed, but the exertion was too great for him; he fell back and fainted. </p>\n<p> It was long before he was restored, and I often thought that life was entirely extinct. At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with difficulty and was unable to speak. The surgeon gave him a composing draught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed. In the meantime he told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live. </p>\n<p> His sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be patient. I sat by his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near, said, “Alas! The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being. Think not, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning hatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; but I feel myself justified in desiring the death of my adversary. During these last days I have been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it blamable. In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and was bound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and well-being. This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to that. My duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or misery. Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to create a companion for the first creature. He showed unparalleled malignity and selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I know where this thirst for vengeance may end. Miserable himself that he may render no other wretched, he ought to die. The task of his destruction was mine, but I have failed. When actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I asked you to undertake my unfinished work, and I renew this request now, when I am only induced by reason and virtue. </p>\n<p> “Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil this task; and now that you are returning to England, you will have little chance of meeting with him. But the consideration of these points, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I leave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near approach of death. I dare not ask you to do what I think right, for I may still be misled by passion. </p>\n<p> “That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in other respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the only happy one which I have enjoyed for several years. The forms of the beloved dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms. Farewell, Walton! Seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in science and discoveries. Yet why do I say this? I have myself been blasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.” </p>\n<p> His voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his effort, he sank into silence. About half an hour afterwards he attempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and his eyes closed for ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed away from his lips. </p>\n<p> Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this glorious spirit? What can I say that will enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow? All that I should express would be inadequate and feeble. My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of disappointment. But I journey towards England, and I may there find consolation. </p>\n<p> I am interrupted. What do these sounds portend? It is midnight; the breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir. Again there is a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin where the remains of Frankenstein still lie. I must arise and examine. Good night, my sister. </p>\n<p> Great God! what a scene has just taken place! I am yet dizzy with the remembrance of it. I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail it; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this final and wonderful catastrophe. </p>\n<p> I entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable friend. Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to describe—gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its proportions. As he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and apparent texture like that of a mummy. When he heard the sound of my approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung towards the window. Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of such loathsome yet appalling hideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily and endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer. I called on him to stay. </p>\n<p> He paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some uncontrollable passion. </p>\n<p> “That is also my victim!” he exclaimed. “In his murder my crimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its close! Oh, Frankenstein! Generous and self-devoted being! What does it avail that I now ask thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovedst. Alas! He is cold, he cannot answer me.” </p>\n<p> His voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion. I approached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to his face, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. I attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips. The monster continued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches. At length I gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion. </p>\n<p> “Your repentance,” I said, “is now superfluous. If you had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity, Frankenstein would yet have lived.” </p>\n<p> “And do you dream?” said the dæmon. “Do you think that I was then dead to agony and remorse? He,” he continued, pointing to the corpse, “he suffered not in the consummation of the deed. Oh! Not the ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the lingering detail of its execution. A frightful selfishness hurried me on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse. Think you that the groans of Clerval were music to my ears? My heart was fashioned to be susceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice and hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change without torture such as you cannot even imagine. </p>\n<p> “After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken and overcome. I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; I abhorred myself. But when I discovered that he, the author at once of my existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for happiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the indulgence of which I was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance. I recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished. I knew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was the slave, not the master, of an impulse which I detested yet could not disobey. Yet when she died! Nay, then I was not miserable. I had cast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my despair. Evil thenceforth became my good. Urged thus far, I had no choice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly chosen. The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable passion. And now it is ended; there is my last victim!” </p>\n<p> I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called to mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and persuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my friend, indignation was rekindled within me. “Wretch!” I said. “It is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you have made. You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are consumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall. Hypocritical fiend! If he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would he become the prey, of your accursed vengeance. It is not pity that you feel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn from your power.” </p>\n<p> “Oh, it is not thus—not thus,” interrupted the being. “Yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to be the purport of my actions. Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery. No sympathy may I ever find. When I first sought it, it was the love of virtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being overflowed, that I wished to be participated. But now that virtue has become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I am well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. Once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once I falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding. I was nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now crime has degraded me beneath the meanest animal. No guilt, no mischief, no malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine. When I run over the frightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man had friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone. </p>\n<p> “You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my crimes and his misfortunes. But in the detail which he gave you of them he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured wasting in impotent passions. For while I destroyed his hopes, I did not satisfy my own desires. They were for ever ardent and craving; still I desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned. Was there no injustice in this? Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all humankind sinned against me? Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his friend from his door with contumely? Why do you not execrate the rustic who sought to destroy the saviour of his child? Nay, these are virtuous and immaculate beings! I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. Even now my blood boils at the recollection of this injustice. </p>\n<p> “But it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the lovely and the helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing. I have devoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and admiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that irremediable ruin. There he lies, white and cold in death. You hate me, but your abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself. I look on the hands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands will meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more. </p>\n<p> “Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief. My work is nearly complete. Neither yours nor any man’s death is needed to consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done, but it requires my own. Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this sacrifice. I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would create such another as I have been. I shall die. I shall no longer feel the agonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet unquenched. He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no more, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish. I shall no longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks. Light, feeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must I find my happiness. Some years ago, when the images which this world affords first opened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to me, I should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation. Polluted by crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in death? </p>\n<p> “Farewell! I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these eyes will ever behold. Farewell, Frankenstein! If thou wert yet alive and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better satiated in my life than in my destruction. But it was not so; thou didst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness; and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think and feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than that which I feel. Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to thine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my wounds until death shall close them for ever. </p>\n<p> “But soon,” he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, “I shall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt. Soon these burning miseries will be extinct. I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and exult in the agony of the torturing flames. The light of that conflagration will fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds. My spirit will sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus. Farewell.” </p>\n<p> He sprang from the cabin-window as he said this, upon the ice raft which lay close to the vessel. He was soon borne away by the waves and lost in darkness and distance. </p> </a></div><div></div>",
      "modern": "<p>Chapter 24</p>\n<p>My current situation was one in which all voluntary thought was swallowed up and lost. I was swept away by fury; revenge alone gave me strength and composure; it shaped my feelings and allowed me to be calculating and calm at times when otherwise delirium or death would have been my fate. My first resolution was to leave Geneva forever; my country, which had once been dear to me when I was happy and loved, had now become hateful in my adversity. I gathered a sum of money, along with a few jewels that belonged to my mother, and departed. Thus began my wanderings, which will only cease with my life. I have crossed vast portions of the earth and endured all the hardships that travelers in deserts and savage lands typically face. How I have survived, I hardly know; many times I have stretched my failing limbs upon the sandy plains and prayed for death. But revenge kept me alive; I dared not die and leave my adversary unpunished.</p>\n<p>When I left Geneva, my first task was to find some clue to trace the steps of my fiendish enemy. But my plan was unsettled, and I wandered for many hours around the outskirts of the town, uncertain of which path to take. As night approached, I found myself at the entrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father lay. I entered and approached the tomb that marked their graves. Everything was silent except for the leaves of the trees, which rustled gently in the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the scene would have been solemn and moving even to an uninterested observer. The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and cast a shadow, felt but unseen, over the head of the mourner. The deep grief that this scene initially stirred in me quickly transformed into rage and despair. They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived, and to destroy him, I must drag out my weary existence.</p>\n<p>I knelt on the grass, kissed the earth, and with trembling lips exclaimed, “By the sacred ground on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the deep and eternal grief I feel, I swear; and by you, O Night, and the spirits that preside over you, to pursue the demon who caused this misery until he or I perish in mortal conflict. For this purpose, I will preserve my life; to execute this dear revenge, I will once again behold the sun and tread the green grass of the earth, which otherwise would vanish from my sight forever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead, and you, wandering ministers of vengeance, to aid and guide me in this task. Let the cursed and hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now torments me.”</p>\n<p>I had begun my vow with solemnity and an awe that almost assured me that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion, but fury possessed me as I finished, and rage choked my words. I was answered through the stillness of the night by a loud and fiendish laugh. It rang in my ears for a long time; the mountains echoed it, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter. Surely in that moment, I should have been consumed by madness and destroyed my wretched existence, but my vow was heard, and I was destined for vengeance.</p>\n<p>The laughter subsided when a familiar and hated voice, seemingly close to my ear, addressed me in an audible whisper, “I am satisfied, miserable wretch! You have chosen to live, and I am satisfied.” I rushed toward the source of the sound, but the devil eluded my grasp. Suddenly, the broad disk of the moon rose and shone fully upon his ghastly and distorted form as he fled with more than mortal speed. I pursued him, and for many months, this has been my task. Guided by a slight clue, I followed the winding course of the Rhone, but in vain.</p>\n<p>The blue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend enter a ship at night, hiding himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea. I took passage on the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how. Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I have always followed his trail. Sometimes the peasants, frightened by this horrible apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself, fearing that I would despair and die if I lost all trace of him, left some mark to guide me. The snows fell on my head, and I saw the imprint of his huge foot on the white plain.</p>\n<p>To you, just beginning life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand what I have felt and still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue were the least pains I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil and carried with me my eternal hell; yet still, a spirit of good followed and directed my steps, and when I most complained, it would suddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties. Sometimes, when nature, overcome by hunger, sank into exhaustion, a meal would be prepared for me in the desert, restoring and invigorating me. The food was indeed coarse, such as the peasants of the land ate, but I will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits I had invoked to aid me. Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and I was parched with thirst, a slight cloud would dim the sky, shed a few drops that revived me, and vanish.</p>\n<p>I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the demon generally avoided these, as it was where the population of the country mainly collected. In other places, humans were rarely seen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my path. I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers by distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had hunted, which, after taking a small portion, I always presented to those who had provided me with fire and cooking utensils. My life, as it passed, was indeed hateful to me, and it was only during sleep that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! Often, when most miserable, I sank into repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The spirits that guarded me provided these moments, or rather hours, of happiness so that I might retain the strength to fulfill my pilgrimage. Deprived of this respite, I would have sunk under my hardships.</p>\n<p>During the day, I was sustained and inspired by the hope of night, for in sleep, I saw my friends, my wife, and my beloved country; I again saw the kind face of my father, heard the sweet tones of Elizabeth’s voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth. Often, when wearied by a toilsome march, I convinced myself that I was dreaming until night fell, and I would then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends. What agonizing affection I felt for them! How I clung to their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and persuaded myself that they still lived! At such moments, vengeance, that burned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path toward the destruction of the demon more as a task assigned to me by heaven, as the mechanical impulse of some unconscious power, than as the passionate desire of my soul.</p>\n<p>What his feelings were, whom I pursued, I cannot know. Sometimes, indeed, he left marks in writing on the bark of the trees or carved in stone that guided me and fueled my fury. “My reign is not yet over”—these words were legible in one of these inscriptions—“you live, and my power is complete. Follow me; I seek the everlasting ice of the north, where you will feel the misery of cold and frost, to which I am indifferent. You will find near this place, if you do not follow too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed. Come on, my enemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserable hours you must endure before that moment arrives.” Cursed devil! Again I vow vengeance; again I dedicate you, miserable fiend, to torture and death. Never will I give up my search until he or I perish; and then, with what ecstasy shall I join my Elizabeth and my departed friends, who even now prepare for me the reward of my tedious toil and horrible journey!</p>\n<p>As I continued my journey northward, the snows thickened, and the cold became almost unbearable. The peasants were locked in their homes, and only a few of the hardiest ventured out to catch the animals driven from their hiding places by starvation. The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be caught; thus, I was cut off from my main source of sustenance. My enemy's triumph grew with the difficulty of my labors. One inscription he left read: “Prepare! Your struggles are only beginning; wrap yourself in furs and provide food, for we shall soon embark on a journey where your suffering will satisfy my everlasting hatred.”</p>\n<p>My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these taunting words; I resolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on Heaven for support, I continued with unwavering fervor to traverse immense deserts until the ocean appeared at a distance, forming the farthest boundary of the horizon. Oh! How unlike it was to the blue seas of the south! Covered with ice, it could only be distinguished from land by its greater wildness and ruggedness. The Greeks wept for joy when they beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, joyfully hailing the boundary of their toils. I did not weep, but I knelt down and, with a full heart, thanked my guiding spirit for leading me safely to the place where I hoped, despite my adversary's mockery, to meet and confront him.</p>\n<p>A few weeks prior to this moment, I had procured a sled and dogs and thus crossed the snows with astonishing speed. I do not know whether the fiend had the same advantages, but I found that, whereas before I had lost ground in the pursuit, I was now gaining on him, so much so that when I first saw the ocean, he was only one day's journey ahead, and I hoped to intercept him before he reached the shore. With newfound courage, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a miserable village on the seashore. I inquired of the inhabitants about the fiend and received accurate information. A gigantic monster, they said, had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols, frightening the residents of a solitary cottage with his terrifying appearance. He had carried off their winter food supply and, placing it in a sled, had harnessed a large number of trained dogs, and that same night, to the relief of the horrified villagers, had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land; they conjectured that he would soon be destroyed by the breaking of the ice or frozen by the eternal frost.</p>\n<p>Upon hearing this information, I suffered a brief bout of despair. He had escaped me, and I must begin a destructive and almost endless journey across the icy mountains of the ocean, through cold that few of the inhabitants could endure, and which I, a native of a warm and sunny climate, could not hope to survive. Yet at the thought of the fiend living and triumphant, my rage and vengeance returned, overwhelming every other feeling like a mighty tide. After a brief rest, during which the spirits of the dead hovered around, urging me to toil and seek revenge, I prepared for my journey. I exchanged my land sled for one designed for the uneven surface of the Frozen Ocean, and after purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I departed from land.</p>\n<p>I cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have endured misery that nothing but the eternal sense of just retribution burning within my heart could have enabled me to withstand. Immense and rugged mountains of ice often blocked my way, and I often heard the thunder of the sea, which threatened my destruction. But again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure. Based on the provisions I consumed, I estimate that I spent three weeks on this journey; and the continual extension of hope, returning back upon my heart, often wrung bitter drops of despondency and grief from my eyes. Despair had indeed almost secured her prey, and I would soon have sunk beneath this misery.</p>\n<p>Once, after the poor animals that carried me had, with incredible effort, reached the summit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, succumbing to fatigue, died, I gazed at the expanse before me in anguish when suddenly my eye caught a dark speck on the dusky plain. I strained my vision to discern what it could be and let out a wild cry of ecstasy when I recognized a sled and the distorted form of someone I knew within. Oh! With what a burning rush did hope return to my heart! Warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away so that they would not obstruct my view of the demon; but still my sight was blurred by the burning drops, until, succumbing to the overwhelming emotions, I wept aloud. But this was not the time for delay; I removed the dogs from their dead companion, gave them a generous portion of food, and after an hour's rest, which was absolutely necessary but bitterly irksome to me, I continued on my way.</p>\n<p>The sled was still visible, and I did not lose sight of it again except for brief moments when some ice-rock concealed it behind its crags. I was indeed gaining on it, and when, after nearly two days of travel, I saw my enemy no more than a mile away, my heart soared within me. But now, just as I seemed almost within reach of my foe, my hopes were suddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more completely than I ever had before. A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its approach, as the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became increasingly ominous and terrifying. I pressed on, but in vain. The wind rose; the sea roared; and with a tremendous and overwhelming sound, like the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked.</p>\n<p>The destruction was swift; in a few minutes, a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, leaving me drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually shrinking, preparing for me a hideous death. In this manner, many dreadful hours passed; several of my dogs died, and I myself was about to succumb under the weight of my misery when I saw your vessel anchored and offering me hopes of rescue and life. I had no idea that ships ever ventured this far north and was astonished at the sight. I quickly dismantled part of my sled to make oars, and with infinite effort, I was able to move my ice raft towards your ship. I had resolved that if you were heading south, I would still trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my purpose. But your direction was northward. You took me aboard when my strength was exhausted, and I would soon have sunk under my multiplied hardships into a death that I still dread, for my task remains unfulfilled.</p>\n<p>Oh! When will my guiding spirit, in leading me to the demon, allow me the rest I so desperately desire; or must I die, and he still live? If I do, swear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him and satisfy my vengeance in his death. And do I dare to ask you to undertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships I have faced? No; I am not that selfish. Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear, if the ministers of vengeance should bring him to you, swear that he shall not live—swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes. He is eloquent and persuasive, and once his words even held power over my heart; but trust him not. His soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery and fiendish malice. Do not listen to him; call on the names of William, Justine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and the wretched Victor, and thrust your sword into his heart. I will hover nearby and direct the steel aright.</p>\n<p>Walton, in continuation.</p>\n<p>August 26th, 17—.</p>\n<p>You have read this strange and terrifying story, Margaret; and do you not feel your blood run cold with horror, like that which even now curdles mine? Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his tale; at other times, his voice, broken yet piercing, uttered with difficulty the words filled with anguish. His fine and lovely eyes were now lit with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow and quenched in infinite misery. Sometimes he controlled his countenance and tones, relating the most horrible incidents with a tranquil voice, suppressing every sign of agitation; then, like a volcano erupting, his face would suddenly change to one of the wildest rage as he screamed imprecations at his persecutor. His tale is coherent and told with an appearance of the simplest truth, yet I confess to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me, and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, have given me a greater belief in the truth of his narrative than his assurances, however earnest and connected.</p>\n<p>Such a monster really does exist! I cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I tried to extract from Frankenstein the details of his creature’s formation, but on this point, he was impenetrable. “Are you mad, my friend?” he said. “Or where does your senseless curiosity lead you? Would you also create for yourself and the world a demoniacal enemy? Peace, peace! Learn my miseries and do not seek to increase your own.”</p>\n<p>Frankenstein discovered that I was taking notes about his history; he asked to see them and then corrected and augmented them in many places, particularly in giving life and spirit to the conversations he had with his enemy. “Since you have preserved my narration,” he said, “I would not have a mutilated version go down to posterity.” Thus has a week passed away while I have listened to the strangest tale ever imagined. My thoughts and every feeling of my soul have been absorbed by the interest for my guest that this tale and his elevated and gentle manners have created. I wish to soothe him, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so devoid of every hope of consolation, to live? Oh, no! The only joy he can know now will be when he finally composes his shattered spirit to peace and death.</p>\n<p>Yet he enjoys one comfort, born of solitude and delirium; he believes that when he dreams he converses with his friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or encouragement for his vengeance, that they are not mere figments of his imagination, but the beings themselves who visit him from a distant world. This faith gives a solemnity to</p>",
